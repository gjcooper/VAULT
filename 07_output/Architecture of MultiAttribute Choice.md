# Processing architectures of multiattribute choice

## Overview

- Brief recap of decision strategies, taking from [[payne1993adaptive]], [[pfeiffer2012fundamentals]] and [[riedl2008identifying]]
- Alternative process tracing including [[Mouselab]], [[Active Information Search]], and [[Eye tracking for process tracing]].
- Overview of process-tracing methods, by [[riedl2008identifying]] and [[schulte-mecklenbeck2017processtracing]]
- The problems of interpreting estimation of model parameters when estimated using participant average responses, rather than individual responses, as outlined in [[estes1956problem]], [[estes2005risks]], [[estes2002traps]] and [[heathcote2000power]]
- A couple of mentions of the [[cooper2019investigating]] paper to bump cites
- Some discussion of sequential sampling models, drawing on [[ratcliff2016diffusion]]
- Adding to SSM approaches to preferential choice, other methods include: [[krajbich2011multialternative]] and [[busemeyer1993decision]]

## Decision strategies

Mentioned and referenced the [[Conjunctive Strategy]], [[Disjunctive Strategy]] and [[Satisficing Heuristic]] for non-compensatory strategies, and the [[Frequency of Good and-or Bad Features Heuristic]] and [[Weighted Additive Rule]] for compensatory strategies. Probably need to look into complete vs selective strategies a bit more and think more on single option variants of other strategies.
