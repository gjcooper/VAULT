# Overview

My thesis covered several main points. There were two components to the thesis, new methods for discriminating between [[decision strategies]]. This includes the paper on [[cooper2019investigating|Investigating consumer decision strategies with systems factorial technology]], and the paper on [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]].

The second section is all about a new cognitive model of consumer choice representation, the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]].
