# Overview

My thesis covered several main points. There were two components to the thesis, new methods for discriminating between [[decision strategies]]. This includes the paper on [[cooper2019investigating|Investigating consumer decision strategies with systems factorial technology]], and the paper on [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]].

The second section is all about a new cognitive model of consumer choice representation, the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]].

# Thesis Talk

Born out of a talk at the SoCR labs new direction as a mix of journal club and more I needed to put together a talk for that based on my recently acceprted thesis.

Aiming for approximately half an hour(ish) I want to do the following:

- Add a bit of introduction (from my introduction)
- Briefly cover the [[SFT of DCE]] paper that uses the non-parametric approach
- Cover the parametric model based approach of the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper.
- Take some content from my [[AMPC2025]] talk on the categorisation based approach on psychological spaces.
- Final thoughts.
