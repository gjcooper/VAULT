# CBMHR2021 Talk

- Motivation
  - Why should we investigate the decision strategy used in consumer decision making
  - How have people approached it in the past, what limitations do their approaches have.
- Classification (Remove)
  - The assumptions of decision strategies regarding processing architectures
  - Segmenting the set of decision strategies by architecture and stopping rule
- Thinking about D. Strat
  - Here's a way to think about decision strategies
- SFT
  - Manipulating the difficulty of stimuli and measuring the response time and choices allows you to determine what processing architecture and stopping rule was being used by an individual
  - Sample experiment data, strategy classification
  - Limitations of this approach
- SFT as 1 slide (don't mention SFT)
  - Mention Paper
  - brief results from 2 exp
- Parametric and Preferential
  - Hierarchical parametric approach using [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]]
  - Determining participants threshold to apply to preferential data
  - Veridical vs Preferential results
  - Advanced /novel computational techniques. Outcome is probability of each person using each of these strategies
  - Individual differences
- Wrap up
  - > 2 dimensions (MDS)
