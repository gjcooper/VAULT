# SFT Talk at SPCC 2018


- Consumer Decisions
  - Why?
    - Low Stakes, images of low stakes choices for seller (snickers vs mars, adidas vs nike)
    - High Stakes, images of high stakes (Buy car vs deposit for house, PhD vs Job)
    - Local decision, public policies (candy vs fruit, bus vs car)
  - Processing Architectures
    - Serial vs Parallel
    - Self-terminating vs Exhaustive
- SFT [[Systems Factorial Technology]]
  - DFP
    - Double Factorial Paradigm
  - MIC
    - Patterns in MIC
  - SIC
    - Patterns in SIC
- Experiment 1
  - Why so simplified
    - What are our manipulations
    - Barest essentials
    - Cells in design
  - Example Stimuli
    - HH
    - HL
    - LD
  - Results
    - Accuracy
    - MIC
    - SIC
- Experiment 2
  - Why the changes
    - Numbers are hard
    - Maybe symbols are better
  - Example Stimuli
    - HH
    - LL
  - Results
    - Accuracy
    - MIC
    - SIC
- Heirarchical Modelling
  - Why?
    - Not enough trial per cells
    - Consumer research rarely gets lots of data per participant
  - How?
    - Fit gamma distribution to each for four important cells
    - generate 30000 * 3 iterations (plus 10000 warmup)
    - thin by 100
  - Results
    - Exp1
    - Exp2 Absolute
    - Exp2 Relative
- Where to now?
  - Other statistical modelling techniques
    - Ballistic accumulators
  - Eye tracking?
    - Fixations and Saccades
  - More complex tasks
    - More attributes, more choices
