## Brief motivation

Take the model inspired by the [[generalised context model]] (See [[nosofsky2011generalized]]) as applied to the [[Veridical task]] (both variants), the [[Preferential task]] and more.

## Background
Understanding how the specific features of an option presented to a consumer influence their final choice has been the goal of much research across the fields of economics and psychology.
## Justification
Much of the choice modelling literature makes an assumption that the psychological representation of the attribute values is synonymous with the attribute values themselves. Particularly the standard random utility models in use in much of the literature avoid any inference on the internal representations of these values. In this work we draw on a *[[multidimensional scaling]]* approach to view options as points in a multidimensional psychological space, with similar options taken as points close to each other, and dissimilar options further away.

## Major Finding
An initial implementation of this approach in a veridical task designed to elicit selective influence has shown that the method is sensitive to different decision strategies. Further implementations in an analogous preferential task have also shown promise for determining individual participants decision strategies.

## Details of key results

## Conclusion
This approach shows promise for separating not just the weight given to different attributes of an option, but the sensitivity to changes in it's value.

# Abstract
Numerous studies in economics and psychology have sought to understand how specific features of a consumer's choice options shape their ultimate decision. Existing literature often assumes that the psychological representation of attributes is proportional to the attribute values themselves. In this study, we treat options as points in a multi-dimensional psychological space. Similar options are represented as close points, while dissimilar options are depicted as distant points. Initial findings from a veridical task designed to examine selective influence indicate that this approach is sensitive to various decision strategies. Furthermore, applying the method to an analogous preferential task has shown promise in determining individual participants' decision strategies. This approach opens new avenues for discriminating between possible decision strategies in an individual's choices.
