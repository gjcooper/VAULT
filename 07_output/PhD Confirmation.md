      - if extreme value for examples of DCE and eye tracking.

largely focused on whether eye tracking is useful for determining attribute influence on consumer choice, but ends with three possibility of it being useful for process information.

The Bayesian infinite logit model introduced seems interesting, and when I have more time I would like to look into it further.
