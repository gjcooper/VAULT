# Half hour talk on project + fit

Notes: What about checking Psychonomics posters for work from out of the group.

## Original posting:
The positions are financed by the project „Information search in multi-attribute decisions and probabilistic inferences” (funding: DFG in Germany, SNF in Switzerland). This project is a collaboration between the General Psychology Lab (PI: Sebastian Gluth) at the Universität Hamburg and the Economic Psychology Lab (PI: [[Jörg Rieskamp]]) at the University of Basel. The project aims to elucidate the neural and cognitive mechanisms of complex judgment and decision-making problems. A particular focus will be on understanding information search when deciding. The project also involves joint work with Anja Riesel (Department of Psychology, Universität Hamburg) to study maladaptive search and choice processes in people with diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and those who score high on OCD symptoms. The most relevant methods are cognitive modeling, behavioral tasks, eye tracking and EEG.

## Job talk reqs
The interview will last about 60 to 90 minutes and will be held in English. If fine with you, we will use Zoom as platform (link will be sent later). Please prepare a presentation of 30 min, in which you present some recent research of yours. This could be your PhD thesis or a similar project that you have worked on / are currently working on. We recommend to focus on only one project rather than trying to squeeze in a lot of different studies. If you have multiple relevant projects, you can of course mention this, but try to go into detail about only one of them. In the last five minutes of your talk (within the 30 min time frame), we would like you to give an outline of why you have applied for the Postdoc position and why your research interests and expertise align with the research project. 


### Outline

- Quick overview of thesis
- Parametric models of screening decisions:
    - What is a screening decision?
    - Decision strategies in screening decisions.
    - Inferring the decision strategy from data
    - Decision strategies and their assumptions about processing architectures.
    - Evidence Accumulation Models of processing architectures.
    - Sampling from a Dirichlet process to select the processing architecture.
    - Inference on the decision strategy
- What I bring to the table


Flip order of data and architectures, signpost dataset for testing the model.

Talk myself up more.

## Interview notes

Project is maybe combining eye tracking and EEG, predict how people move their eyes in pref choice.
