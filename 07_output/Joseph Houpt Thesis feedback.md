## Comments and Typos

- [ ] p. 50 (41) - "Four cells of the design are criticval to our SFT analysis: the presence of two attriburte values that met the"
    
    > Comment on why it is not an issue to deviate from Houpt et al (2013), Table 2, recommended trial rates.
    
- [ ] p. 52 (43) - "of 27 of the 64 participants"

    > Comment on whether this criterion may bias the patters on rules observed (e.g., underrepresentation of OR rule).

- [ ] p. 57 (48) - "Discussion"

    > How does one find OR terminating with a AND task and good performance?  What about the low power for detecting the initial negative dip of the coactive SIC?
    
- [ ] p. 62 (53) - ".95 quantile of each individual's response time distribution"

    > Does this cutoff differentially affect condition (e.g., are more trials slower than the criterion in one condition relative to others)?

- [x] p. 77 (68) - Typo "ana -> an"
- [x] p. 86 (77) - "across-trial variability in drift rate of $\sqrt(2)$"

    > need better motivation for the sqrt(2), e.g., relationship between single accumulator variance and summed accumluator variance; see Houpt & Townsend (2011)

- [x] p. 104 (95) - "parameter r captures curvature of"

    > The use of curvature for r may be standard, but it struck me as a bit odd relative to definitions of curvature from differential geometry.  If there is another concept of curvature beyond r that is implied here, then make it explicity.  Otherwise, I suggest just stating that you will interpret r as a measure of curvature because it is normally done in this literature.  Another alternative, although I think it would be more work, is to just skip the term and refer to it as r or the Minkowski order.

- [x] p. 108 (99) - Typo "early-mid 202"
- [ ] p. 111 (102) - "Thresholds"

    > Seems to assume no curvature.

- [ ] p. 114 (105) "Therefore, we set 350ms as the minimum time for a valid response"

        > Odd practice especially given variability in subject base times.

- [ ] p. 122 (113) - "Cognitive"

    > It might be valuable to make the connection to Nosofsky's GCM more explicit here.

- [x] p. 126 (117) - Bad rendering in p < .001
- [x] p. 155 (146) - "this minimal data, in the"
