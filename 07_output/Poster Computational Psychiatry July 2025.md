Applying cognitive models to behavioural data can provide insights into the underlying processes that drive human behaviour. It has led to advancements in many fields, including learning, decision-making and memory. Cognitive models are explainable, interpretable and transparent, complementing predictive models that are otherwise black-box and opaque. The application of modelling is also growing in psychiatry, leading to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and new intervention targets. Cognitive models also allow for more precise phenotyping in clinical practice and advance drug marker development in the biomedical industry. However, implementing cognitive models correctly and robustly is not trivial, preventing their broader adoption. Hypatia Health is designed to bring robust and rigorous mathematical models to users within an intuitive interface. The service provides tools to specify task designs and interact with various models, providing visual feedback as model parameters are adjusted. Planning is easy with simulation from one or more groups, allowing confidence that a study is sufficiently powered to detect the expected results. Once study data has been collected, it is uploaded to the same interface. From there, model parameters are estimated using state-of-the-art cognitive modelling tools. Our modelling tools take advantage of the power of cloud computing to get a complete Bayesian estimate of model parameters with a fast turnaround from data to model analysis. Plans for the application include integration with experiment design platforms, tracking an intervention over time and comparing competing cognitive models. Hypatia Health will reduce friction between project planning, implementation and analysis. It provides gold standard model simulation and estimation, ensuring that code and model variation are removed from analysis bottlenecks. It will enable researchers, clinicians and industry to focus on their research theory, questions and outcomes.
