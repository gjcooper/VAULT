Applying cognitive models to biological data provides insights into the underlying processes that drive human behaviour, advancing the scientific basis of learning, decision-making and memory. Cognitive models are explainable and transparent, complementing predictive models that are otherwise opaque. The application of cognitive models is rapidly growing in psychiatry, leading to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and new intervention targets, with the promise of precise phenotyping in clinical practice and advancing drug marker development in the biomedical industry. However, implementing cognitive models correctly, robustly, and in a standardised format is not trivial, preventing their broader adoption and interoperability. Hypatia Health is a browser-based platform designed to bring robust and rigorous mathematical models to scientists, clinicians, teachers, and industry professionals within an intuitive interface. Hypatia provides tools to specify task design, allow interaction with several foundational models, and give real-time visual feedback as parameters are adjusted. Planning becomes easier with simulation from one or more groups, allowing a synthetic environment to predict and benchmark expected outcomes. Study data can be uploaded to the same interface for live estimation of model parameters using state-of-the-art fitting algorithms. Hypatia takes advantage of cloud computing to provide a complete analytic suite from prediction to analysis and, importantly, implements standardised code at scale. This ensures that code and model variation are removed from analysis bottlenecks, and encourages model comparison across teams. Future integrations will include cognitive fingerprinting to triangulate latent features of individual patients or participants. As a whole, Hypatia enables researchers, clinicians and industry to focus on their research theory, questions and outcomes, bringing precision to drug development and treatment.


As an early stage investigator travelling from Australia, the financial burden of attending this conference is significant due to the substantial distance and high travel costs. My current project operates under uncertain funding arrangements as the current funding will have ended by the time the conference takes place. This makes it challenging to secure support for international conference participation and therefore this award would assist in securing attendance even after the project grant is completed. This award would enable me to present my work, receive critical feedback, and engage with leading researchers. Disseminating my findings at this conference will benefit the broader research community by showcasing a valuable tool for computational research in psychiatry. It would also allow me to foster collaborations that could shape the future direction of my research.
