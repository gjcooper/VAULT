Applying cognitive modelling to behavioural data can add important information about the underlying processes that lead to this behaviour. Cognitive modelling has significantly impacted research into aspects of cognition such as reinforcement learning, decision-making, memory and more. There are significant barriers to implementing cognitive models as researchers cannot be experts in all fields. Hypatia Health is designed to make the application of cognitive modelling to your domain as seamless as possible. We offer robust and rigorous mathematical and statistical models, all within an easy-to-use interface. You can interact with the models, receiving visual feedback as you manipulate model parameters. You can also plan your studies, adjusting the trials per participant and the participants per group, and then simulate participant responses to ensure your studies are appropriately specified. When you have your simulation results, you can feed them back into our estimation module, allowing you to assess whether the known model parameters are recoverable. After running your cognitive task, you can also bring your empirical data back to Hypatia Health and have the confidence that your cognitive modelling analysis is being performed with cutting-edge and open cognitive science practices. We plan to integrate with experiment design platforms to reduce friction between a project's planning and implementation stages. We are instantiating a gold standard for model simulation and estimation, ensuring that code and model variation are removed from analysis bottlenecks, making it easier for experimentalists to focus on their research theory, questions and outcomes.
