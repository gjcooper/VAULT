# 15 talk of project (mine plus idea)

My project will be a slimmed down version of the [[Hamburg Job Talk]]. This is for ans [[AusMURI]] project at [[UNSW]] with [[Mike Le Pelley]], [[Ben Newell]] and [[Kelly Garner]].

For theirs I have been reading some work by Le Pelley et al such as the [[lepelley2015when|When goals conflict with values: counterproductive attentional and oculomotor capture by reward-related stimuli]] paper which talks about [[attentional capture]] by reward predictive but main task irrelevant stimuli.

## Original Posting

Dear Colleagues,

We have two Postdoctoral Research positions available in the School of Psychology, [[University of New South Wales|UNSW]] Sydney. The roles are for 3 years, full time, based in Sydney.

The Research Associate will play a key role in conducting research within a three-year project titled "Building overall cognitive capability through attentional control". The UNSW branch of this project will investigate the cognitive processes underlying adaptive attentional control for optimal task performance and will involve experiments which combine behavioural tasks with eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG), coupled with computational modelling of brain and behaviour.

The role of Research Associate reports directly to Professor Mike Le Pelley and works closely with and indirectly reports to Professor Ben Newell and Dr Kelly Garner. This role has no direct reports.

## Job talk reqs

Hi Gavin,

I hope you’re doing well. Thanks very much for applying for the postdoctoral positions at UNSW that we recently advertised. I’m pleased to be able to let you know that you’ve been shortlisted for an interview – it was a very strong field of applicants, so congratulations on getting to this stage!

Our Human Resources department will soon be in touch regarding the date and time of the interview, but I’m just writing to give you a bit more information about the position and the project that is funding it, and how the interview will work.

**THE PROJECT**

These positions are part of a project titled “Building overall cognitive capability through attentional control”, funded by the Australian Department of Defence, under the Australia–US Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (AUSMURI) Program. The project is part of a wider network – the structure is that there’s:

1.    An Australian stream, with one group at UNSW (led by Prof Mike Le Pelley, Prof Ben Newell and Dr Kelly Garner), and another at the University of Queensland (led by Profs Jason Mattingley & Paul Dux).

2.    A US stream, involving a large group of leading US researchers across several universities.

Each group is working on slightly different – but all related – topics in the area of attentional control.

The postdoc positions that we have advertised are to work on the project at UNSW, which will be using behavioural experiments, eye-tracking, EEG, and computational modelling to assess and model the impact of learning on attentional control. I’ve attached some relevant sections from the original funding application that describe the project – the UNSW stream is Work Package 1 (WP1) in this summary. As you’ll see, this is a pretty high-level summary: it’s more of a concept than a detailed series of experiments at this point, which is good because it means there is a substantial amount of flexibility in the direction(s) that we could take the project.

**THE INTERVIEW**

The interview will be scheduled for 40 minutes and will be conducted online. We’d like to start with you telling us about:

1.    Your best piece of research, and

2.    An idea for some research that we could do in the proposed project – i.e., research that would fall under the general umbrella of WP1. (_see email in gavin.at.gavincooper.net gmail Jan 16 2024_)

Together this should take no more than 15 minutes, and you can split the time between the two elements as you choose. Please feel free to prepare slides (I would probably recommend doing so, but it’s not mandatory!).

The rest of the time will be taken up with questions. The selection committee will be me, Prof [[Ben Newell]], Dr [[Kelly Garner]], and Dr [[Kelly Clemens]].

Please let me know if you have any questions about any of the above.

All the best

Mike
