# Ideas for future research

  - Price Quality display that "switches" at some point during the task
    - See Kvam talk
  - Guy's timing threshold work, how does this apply to tasks where
    there is a time limit (short) on responses - think JP's work
  - How does Serial self-terminating actually work. Looking at Criss and
    Cox's paper I was struck by the fact that for a serial
    self-terminating model, if we are accumulating evidence in serial,
    at what point do we <span id="stop"></span>**stop** accumulating
    evidence for the first attribute/option and *start* accumulating
    evidence for the second option. I presume it is some sort of racing
    accumulator racing between evidence in favour and evidence against,
    and if evidence against succeeds then the second alternative/option
    race starts accumulating?
  - A task that involves

## Priming and mapping the price/quality trade-off

  - Start with a section that primes the participant with appropriate
    values for price and quality.
      - This could involve saying the range of prices and qualities
        typically seen in an area (Pref SFT task)
      - Alternatively this could involve showing a list example hotels
        (prices and ratings for example) for participants to extract
        this information themselves.
  - Next we run either a staircase approach as done in Pref SFT and/or a
    2D boundary search approach where participants rate a selection of
    hotels one after another, and the attributes values are adjusted
    such that we try and map the boundary of the participants trade-off
    between price and rating.
  - Maybe then set up a SFT like task after this based on the boundary
    as a whole. (not just a fixed point)

## 2D helicopter task

  - Instead of a helicopter moving along one axis, perhaps a helicopter
    moving along 2 axes.
  - Two possible tasks:
      - trying to catch a parcel again, drops from a 2D gaussian or
        similar. Wind could be constant, gusty, swirling. Mouse to
        control the location?
      - Perhaps you are controlling the helicopter and you need to try
        to drop to hit a target (food drops) and you have to infer the
        best location to account for wind.

## Framing of choices effects on response times

When a set of choices is framed as "Please accept options that meet some criteria" Does the patterns of response times change compared to peoples response times when given the framing of "Please reject options that do not meet the criteria"?

## Unbalanced effects of the $199 price points on thresholds.

When presented with prices that are just shy of a round number, do people show effect son thresholds or drift rates for price points on either side of the round number boundary.
