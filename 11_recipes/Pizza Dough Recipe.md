## Ingredients

- 2 cups plain flour
- 1 x 8 g sachet of dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon caster sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¾ cup warm water

## Method

1. Combine dry ingredients in large mixing bowl and add oil and water.
2. Mix to a soft dough.
3. Knead on a floured surface until soft and pliable.
4. Return to the mixing bowl and cover with cling wrap and leave in a warm spot for 30 minutes. The dough should double in size.
5. When it has risen, 'punch' the dough once to remove air bubbles.
6. Remove from bowl and knead gently for 1 minute.
7. Roll the dough out to desired size and add favourite toppings.

## Recipe notes

Makes two fairly thin bases. Pop bubbles after a few minutes, cook for 2-5 minutes more.
