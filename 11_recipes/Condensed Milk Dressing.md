# Condensed Milk Dressing

#cuisine/salad_dressing

## Ingredients:

- (397 g) can condensed milk
- [vinegar](http://www.food.com/library/vinegar-680) (we normally use malt vinegar)
- teaspoon [salt](http://www.food.com/library/salt-359)
- tablespoon [dry mustard](http://www.food.com/library/mustard-seed-and-powder-93) (I normally use Coleman's but any similar brand will do) (Start with less, add to taste)

## Directions:

1. Put approximately 3 tablespoons of condensed milk into a small bowl.
2. Add the mustard and mix until the lumps have disappeared.
3. Then, add the rest of the condensed milk and salt (if using), and stir until combined.
4. Slowly add the vinegar. I normally add 1/4 cup, stir this through, then keep adding more vinegar to taste. You don't need to use the full 3/4 cup, it really depends on how sweet/acidic you like the dressing to be.
5. Leave in the fridge until thickened (I find this is normally about 2 hours), then use on your favourite salad.
