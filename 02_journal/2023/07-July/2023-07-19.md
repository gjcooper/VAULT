## Activites

In a quick meeting with Guy we discussed the values chosen to form the options for the [[Simplified phones task]]. Elements we discussed were whether to use the real phones as a defined subset of the phones selected as options (No). We also discussed the double option trials and whether they are sampled purely randomly from all possibilities or if they are based on the option chosen for the single option case.
