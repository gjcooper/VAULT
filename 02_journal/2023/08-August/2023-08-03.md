## Temporary Notes

Thoughts during analysis of the [[Simplified phones task]] initial data.
- I probably want to put in a block number for each trial as this will help with some possible analysis avenues.
- Analysis for the parameter estimates of the ML method of recovering [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|GCM inspired analysis]] to see if there are bimodal groups, or whether a single normal distribution over people would be sufficient.
