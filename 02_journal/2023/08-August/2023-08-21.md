## Activites

Reading the logical rules paper from [[Fific]], I am struck by some possibly usefule approaches. One - for the preferential work in particular - would be to take the response times to the H cells and compare them to the L cells, such that the expected response times would be LL > LH/HL > HH.

## Thought for the day

I wonder whether for [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|EB-CCM]], or other preferential data, a scatter plot (or similar) of price/memory, price/rating on the x/y axes, and then colour representing the RT could elucidate the pattern I would expect of more "difficult" choices (closer to a participants "boundary" being slower)?
