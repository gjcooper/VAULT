* transform before averaging for the group average plots in gcm
* Alternative to the heatmap style, for each participant get their line of 50/50 along with their data.
* In veridical, mnaybe something like weight correlated ith accuracy, look at splits between conditions, but also between accurate and inaccurate responders.
* Maybe jags?? maybe not though.
* Think about 2 options with 2 attrs, what would that mean for the model, what about the task.
