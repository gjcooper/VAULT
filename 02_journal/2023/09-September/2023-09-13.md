## Activites

#### Running old job

On [[NCI]] for the [[Veridical task]]. That is updating the run to work with a preprocessing script that is identical to the [[cooper2019investigating|Investigating consumer decision strategies with systems factorial technology]] paper I wrote, in order to match processing for the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper.

On commit: `03195f1`

`qsub -v "MCCE_EST_EXP=NumericVDCE,MCCE_MODEL=std,MCCE_METHOD=model,VDCE_TAG=NCI_T1Est,MCCE_EXP_DATA=Task1_preprocessed_Accept.RDS,MCCE_MIN_RT=0,MCCE_MAX_RT=4.5,MCCE_CONTAM=0.02" job_scripts/Task1.pbs`
