**Bottom-up and Top-down processes of visual attention**

Scarcity mechanism, Orquin et al 2020, the visual ecology of humans is a product of culture. (Good review of the literature)

Salience manipulation, effects bottom-up first fixation to product. Top down manipulation (inform users of that this is an ad), interaction with bottom-up, no change to first fixation, but high salience and informed users reduces to low salience the overall relative timeof fixation to the target product.
