# Supervisor Meeting + Network Models

## Meeting with Guy

- Sensitivity analysis on MDS (how volatile solution based on ends of the response scale)
- Drop participant if \> 20% dropped MDS trials
- Drop MDS trial if \< X time (X maybe 1.5 seconds)

**Other topics**
- Add new followup to MDS deign
- Program new MDS task

## Undirected Network Models

Gaussian graphical model

From a multivariate normal $\mu$ and $\sigma$ you can get partial correlations from the precision matrix $K = \sigma^{-1}$

$$
pcor(i, j) = - \frac{K_{ij}}{\sqrt{K_{ii}} * \sqrt{K_{jj}}}
$$
