## Notes

### Sewell

The [[diffusion decision model|diffusion model]] for Conflict, ie Stroop, Flanker, Simon Data Differnces in Delta plots lead to hypothesis that processing of conflict underlying these tasks is not necessarily comparable. Main goal is reforumulation of Diffusion Models of Conflict framework to be more psychologically plausible.

### Zhou

[[Circular diffusion model]] with continuous outcome source memory. Looking at comparing models with memory precision + guesing vs memory precision intrusion errors, as well as guessing, intrusion and memory precision.

### Osth

Covering work about exponential vs power functions for free list recall (work I've seen - LBA on first recalled word). Exponential Reinstatement model (probability of primacy vs recency curve for drift rate) won Is primacy just a tendency to rehearse the list?

### Evans

Conflict tasks, looking at testing whether incongruent vs congruent differences are due to conflicting stimuli slower down responses, or supporting stimuli speeding up responses, or both. Nice view of model support over multiple datasets.

### Chen

LBA for memory strength in free list recall, nice modelling work on repeated presentations of list items and the possible mechanisms for how that effects recall.
