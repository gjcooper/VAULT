# A list of effects on my PhD work due to Covid.

## Lockdown 1 24/03/2020 -\> 25/05/2020

  - Since the 24th March 2020 we have kept Charlotte home from school
    and our other two children home from daycare.
  - Also since that time we have not had assistance from the girls
    grandmother for additional childcare.
  - This means my ability to work has dropped to work on my PhD has
    dropped to 1 day per week from the 24th March.
  - As school returns to 100% on the 25th May 2020 - from this date I am
    able to go back to full PhD capabilities (part-time)
  - In lab experiments - in particular eye tracking experiments have
    been postponed due to the close contact needed.

## Lockdown 2 05/08/2021 -\> 18/10/21

  - Since August 5th 2021 we have kept Charlotte home from school due to
    the lockdown.
  - The first week we also kept Georgina and Eloise at home

## Xmas period 2021

  - Vacation care was cancelled over Xmas 2021/2022 due to concerns of
    the provider for their own family and COVID, meaning reduced ability
    to work on my PhD.

## Vacation care interruptions

  - Several times over the COVID epidemic periods vacation care has been
    calncelled due either to illness of the privder/providers family, or
    concerns about contracting COVID (4 weeks total)
