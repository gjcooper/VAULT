## My summary

I am trying to determine the way that people process information when making choices about multiattribute stimuli.

To do this I created combinations of Linear Ballistic Accumulators that correspond to evidence for and against accepting a single option and then combine them to represent different processing architectures.

There are five combinations in total.

I have run a simple veridical task where people respond to single options whether they accept or reject the option based on a provided criteria.

When instructed to respond using a strategy that matched two of the architectures the model was able to recover that architecture successfully.

We also ran a simulation of each of the five architectures, and each was successfully recovered.

The plan is to run the same model on preferential data we have acquired where we experimentally determine a threshold between price and rating, and then manipulate attribute values in relation to that threshold.

## The impact of experience on preference formation and context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice

Question 4 Yanjun Liu:

## Cognitive modeling of multi-attribute preferential and perceptual choices

Question 4 Mikhail Spektor 

Towards the end of the talk you mention the fact that the MLBA struggled with predicting both choices and response times. This seems to be a consistent finding
