- Christina might be asking for advice about hierarchical fitting of either a [[Rescorla-Wagna]] model, or a volatile [[Kalman Filter]].
    - For the R-W model Joe has the idea of a separate estimation for each block (different learning rates etc per block) but managing the dependencies in a hierarchical fashion. Hierarchical as blocks <- people <- group. The big question here is how to manage these dependencies across the different blocks.
    - There could be multiple variants of the RW model, with additions of a [[perseveration]] parameter and/or a [[discounting]] parameter.
