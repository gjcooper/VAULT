# Mario Fific

Met at [[Psychonomics 2020]], and the [[Configural Processing Consortium]] satellite meeting. Mario seems a friendly enough guy that was interested in the [[SFT of DCE]] work that I presented, and "reminded" me of his paper: [[fific2010logicalrule|Logical-rule models of classification response times: A synthesis of mental-architecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches.]]

Mario has collaborated in the past with [[Cheng-Ta Yang]], [[Daniel Little]] and more.
