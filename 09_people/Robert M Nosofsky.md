Works on categorisation, and is known for the [[Generalised Context Model]] among many other things.

Papers I have notes on:

- [[nosofsky2011generalized|The generalized context model: an exemplar model of classification]]
- [[fific2010logicalrule|Logical-rule models of classification response times: A synthesis of mental-architecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches.]]
