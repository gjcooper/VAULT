Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.

Perhaps NPV idea can be translated to other contexts, where one value is used to compare different objects, for instance Editors Choice in product comparison magazine articles, or user rating and metacritic scores for movies.
The variability of the NPV or similar scores are rarely taken into account by users/businesses. Business executives often have to allocate resources across very dissimilar projects.
They use financial measures, such as Net Present Value (NPV), that simplify this difficult comparison, but these measures vary in their reliability. Psychological research suggests that comparing alignable objects (apples to apples) will be easier than comparing non-alignable objects (apples to oranges; e.g., Markman & Gentner, 1993; Markman & Medin, 1995).
Experiment 1 shows that na√Øve participants respond to the reliability of a financial measure (NPV) when allocating resources to a set of alignable projects, but use it regardless of reliability when allocating to a set of non-alignable projects.
Forecasts of future returns are also more variable for non-alignable projects. Experiment 2 shows that participants with more business experience similarly rely more on NPV for non-alignable projects. However, they do not use information about the variance underlying NPV. These findings support the importance of the structural alignment in decision-making and further suggests that people do not use variance information in their decisions. Practically, these findings suggest that business executives can make more reliable investment decisions when comparing alignable projects and that they should pay more attention to variance information when making financial decisions
