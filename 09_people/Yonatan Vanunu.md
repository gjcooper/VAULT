Chat to Yonatan about sharing data, interested in using my data with his model.

Last I heard he is at the [[University of Chicago]] working on the [[Selective Sampling Diffusion Model]] to try and account for sampling assumptions in numerosity judgements and visual search by adding extra parameters that can provide constraint about sampling assumptions. See some notes on [[Psychonomics 2023]] page.
