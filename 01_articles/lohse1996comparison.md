## My Thoughts

A nice comparison between two [[process tracing]] tools, computerised [[process tracing]] tools like [[Mouselab]], and the use of [[Eye tracking for process tracing]]. One nice part of this is not just the direct comparison, but also the discussion of the implications of the process-tracing tool that is used in regards to various research questions and scenarios.

>The method of recording information acquisition influenced the decision process. Eyegaze used less time, more fixations, and more reacquisitions, but resulted in less search of the total information and had a more variable pattern of information search.
