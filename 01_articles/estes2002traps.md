## My Thoughts

A quite conversational style, which I like - but likes big-noting himself. Some additional notes are that Estes raises the issue of averaging within a subject can also be problematic as the same process may not be responsible for every response to certain stimuli. Issues like task learning/practice effects, fatigue etc can influence the underlying processes, and effect the interpretation of model fits.

This is a rather small part though in addition to talking about the problems of averaging across people, and particularly the problem that successful predictions of a model do **not** necessarily represent evidence that the model is a correct reflection of the underlying processes. Correctly predicting individual performance should be a requirement. Also changes in assumptions of the model should be reflected in changes to response patterns in individuals data.

>If the predictionsprove to be correct, however, all we know is that the assumptions of the model are sufficient for prediction of the data. Only if we find that changing the assumptions of the model (changing P to 2P) produces an incorrect prediction of the data (changing Q to 2Q) can we conclude that the assumptions are necessary for prediction of the data and that the model satisfies the criterion of appropriateness given above.
