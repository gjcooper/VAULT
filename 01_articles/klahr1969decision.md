## My Thoughts

This older work is very similar to what I have originally planned in my [[Multidimensional Scaling Phones]] project. One difference was the low number of participants and the high degree of alignment in attribute importance between the participants, given they were a small group of people working closely in the field of college admissions.

The MDS phone task however had two arms, both correlated and uncorrelated as well as potentially much less similarity between participants (and more participants).

More recent work of mine, like the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|EB-CCM]] is using a very similar assumption that Klahr here has, which is the preferential judgements can reflect the distances in an underlying [[psychological space]].

> Klahr (1969). An old paper that has quite a few similarities to your design. They also ran a multi-phase study, though this one involved ratings of the similarity between options much like you will run. They used multimensional scaling (MDS) on the similarity ratings, and then used the MDS solution to generate predictions about preferences between the options. This is quite neat work! The discussion section directly refers to the importance of comparing correlated and uncorrelated attributes, which will be examined in your study. This analysis approach is like the 'more complex' analysis I describe in the study overview. More broadly, MDS is used in many domains of cognitive science (generalisation, categorisation, recognition, etc) and there are many classic references. An older book chapter discussing these issues is Nosofsky (1992): https://cogs.sitehost.iu.edu/nosofsky/pubs/1992_rmn_FG-Ashby_Exemplar.pdf
  MDS is used much less frequently in the consumer choice literature.

>A set of alternatives can be represented as a set of points in a multidimensional space. In that same space there exists for each individual an ideal object (i.e., one that, if it existed would always be preferred to all other objects). The individual's preference ordering of alternatives is simply the inverse of the ordering of distances in the space from the ideal object to all alternatives.

>Coombs' technique takes as input the judges' preference orderings for alternatives and yields as output the spatial representation that is consistent with those inputs. [(p. 596)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z79RFZXI?page=596&annotation=BXBYRR5Z)

>The form of the similarity evaluation function is obtained directly from the final configuration. By constructing the configuration such that the interpoint distances agreed with the similarity judgments, we found parameters for the function: F(Sa - Sb) = [nfl (Sa - j Saj' and Sbj' are the perceived values of perceived attribute j for alternatives a and b; n is the number of perceived relevant attributes used in the evaluation function; r is the spatial metric; and F(Sa - Sb) is the perceived similarity between alternatives Sa and Sb. We have already discussed the finding that n = 4. [(p. 610)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z79RFZXI?page=610&annotation=3NKM3VE6)

>The tenability of such a method rests upon a proposition that is outside utility theory: the proposition that the utility of an object is inversely proportional to its distance from an ideal object in a subjective "decision space."

>For the hypothetical alternatives that were used, there was high correlation between the nominal and the subjective. However, in more realistic situations, where the values of the attributes are not under arbitrary control of the experimenter, we may not find such a one to one correspondence between the axes of the spatial configuration and the nominal attributes.

>We suggest that the subject, when faced with stimuli varying along many incommensurate nominal attributes, is incapable of making the sort of discrete and explicit trade-offs that yield the city-block metric, but instead forms an overall impression that is best captured in a Euclidean metric.
