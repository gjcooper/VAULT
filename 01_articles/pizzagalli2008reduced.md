## My Thoughts

One of the papers suggested by [[Alex Pike]] as a possible source for a task used to a significant degree within the computational psychiatry literature. The task in question seems to be a mixture between a [[Signal Detection Theory]] task and a reward learning task.
Participants are trying to detect the size of an object (a cartoon mouth) and are rewarded based on their performance. Performance is controlled for to get an overall accuracy at about 75% (by adjusting the size discrimination degree and the length of exposure to the stimulus). The interesting part then is differential rewards to correct reponses on the two different stimuli. On a proportion of correct trials a reward is given and one of the two stimuli are rewarded at 3 times the rate of the other stimulus.
This then drives a response bias towards responding the "rich" stimulus in a signal detection manner.

> Pizzagalli task description:
Subjects goal is to determine in a signal detection way which type of mouth (short or long) was presented on a previously mouthless cartoon face. 3 blocks of 100 trials, Short and long mouths presented for 100ms each and in equal numbers.

>were selected after extensive pilot testing to achieve appropriate psychometric properties of the task (e.g., overall hit rates of approximately 75–85%). [(p. 79)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCAZNKRW?page=79&annotation=HGZKZEBF)

>Specifically, correct identification of either the short or long mouth was rewarded (‘‘Correct!! You won 5 Cents”) three times more frequently (‘‘rich stimulus”) than correct identification of the other mouth (‘‘lean stimulus”) [(p. 79)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCAZNKRW?page=79&annotation=BIXVM3FQ)

>The reinforcement allocation and key presses were counterbalanced across subjects. In each block, only 40 correct trials (30 rich, 10 lean) were rewarded so that each subject was exposed to the same reward ratio. [(p. 79)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCAZNKRW?page=79&annotation=WKR8V835)

>Of relevance to the present findings, in a recent pharmacological challenge study using the same probabilistic reward task, we found that a single dose of a dopamine D2 agonist (pramipexole) – hypothesized to activate presynaptic dopaminergic autoreceptors and thus reduce phasic dopaminergic bursts (e.g., Fuller et al., 1982; Tissari et al., 1983) – impaired the development of response bias and reduced the differentiation between rich and lean hit rates in healthy subjects (Pizzagalli et al., 2008).
