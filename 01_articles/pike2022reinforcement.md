## My Thoughts

An interesting approach for a meta-analysis here where parameter estimates from various models and various [[reinforcement learning]] tasks are used to simulate data from a standard battery of RL tasks. The data simulated with the winning model (from the original study) is then fit using a set of models drawn from the RL literature, and then bayesian [[model averaging]] is done over the new model fits to come up with more easily comparable model parameter estimates.

The differences between the standard meta-analysis results for parameters in common across all the models (inverse [[decision temperature]], reward learning rate, punishment learning rate) and the new model estimate on the simulated data show striking differences, and there are some questions about the process, however
