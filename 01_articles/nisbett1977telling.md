# Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes.

Nisbett, R. E., & Wilson, T. D. (1977). Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes. _Psychological Review_, _84_(3), 231–259. [https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231)

 A **long** piece on the relative inability of people to access the mental process we undertake in order to come to a decision. Initially focused on dissonance and attributional studies, it also covers some work by [[Tversky]] and others that is more closely related to my work, as well as some experiments where aspects such as positional order of stimuli were apparently unable to be accessed as reasons for selecting an object, even though there is an outsized effect of positional order on choices.

>The accuracy of subjective reports is so poor as to suggest that any introspective access that may exist is not sufficient to produce generally correct or reliable reports. [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9RG3KDY?page=3&annotation=S3IXR9DV)

>There is a class of influential factors to which we should be particularly blind. That class may be described as the mechanics of judgment factors—for example, serial order effects, position effects, contrast effects, and many types of anchoring effects.

>Generally, it should be the case that we will be blind to contextual factors, or at any rate be particularly poor at disentangling the effects of the stimulus from the context in which it was encountered. [(p. 22)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9RG3KDY?page=22&annotation=Q9YBCG7R)

>A final factor that may serve to sustain our belief in direct introspective awareness is motivational. It is naturally preferable, from the standpoint of prediction and subjective feelings of control, to believe that we have such access [(p. 27)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9RG3KDY?page=27&annotation=RJW58WP6)
