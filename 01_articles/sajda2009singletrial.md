## My Thoughts

More general thoughts on marrying single-trial data with behaviour, nevertheless there may be some interest here for the [[HGF analysis of MMN]], at least for literature review. There are also links to some of the neural correlates of [[diffusion decision model|DDM]] and other [[evidence accumulation models]]. A range of possible techniques are discussed in a bit of a review of possible approaches, some taken from engineering, like [[multivariate pattern analysis]] and a discussion of the similarities between approaches for both [[fMRI]] and [[EEG]], including noise reduction and more.

Definitely one to revisit for more detail in the future.

>How, then, can activity in these areas be used to influence decision-making? Theoretical models of decision-making have modeled binary perceptual choices as a race-to-barrier diffusion process [16]-[20]. The diffusion model for two-choice decisions in particular assumes that in the decision process, evidence is integrated over time to one of two decision thresholds corresponding to the two choices. The rate of accumulation is called drift rate, and it is determined by the quality of the sensory information. The better the information quality, the larger the drift rate toward the appropriate decision boundary and the faster and more accurate the response.

>Specifically, electrophysiological recordings in LIP during the motion discrimination task [21]-[24] have shown that, for choices made towards the response field of the neuron under consideration, neural activity increased in a ramp-like fashion, consistent with a temporal integration process.

>To recover significant activity, conventional analysis has relied on averaging over many repeated trials of the same stimulus and task conditions under the assumption that the relevant neuronal activity is reproducible from one trial to the next. While this approach has been highly successful in the past, we now know that it severely underestimates the amount of information that can be extracted from these simultaneous recordings.

>Direct decoding using linear classification as outlined above has been used with great success in fMRI, and several reviews are already available [46], [57]. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LWNDD7PD?page=8&annotation=LC426GIF)
