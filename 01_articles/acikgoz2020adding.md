### High Level Overview

A test of hypotheses that context effects [[decision strategies]] in the
setting of candidates assessing job offers. The researcher tested
different job offer evaluations dependant on whether the job offer was
presented by itself, with another offer as a comparison (joint offer of
2) and when presented as a set of three (where the third offer could not
be selected - but influenced the probability of selection between the
other two offers across people. No evidence of a context switch in the 3
option choice, however an evidence of majority preference across people
being reduced.

### Detailed Notes

This paper provides some insight into the differing ways people may
process information when presented in different contexts, in particular
in the setting of someone looking for a job position who is evaluating
different job offers.

With this goal the paper covers two separate studies, with one looking
at the difference in preferences across people when presented with two
jobs offers that were identical except for one additional attribute
(PTO). Half of the participants looked at the two job offers
individually, but separated by distracting job offers which were not
part of the main task comparison. Of this single job offer group half
viewed the offer without PTO first, and with PTO last (8th), the other
half had their viewing order switched. the other group (joint job offer
group) saw both job offers presented at the same time to allow for a
direct comparison of the offers.

The participants in the second study were presented with 3 jobs, where
the third job was labelled as unavailable (but provided attribute
information to "anchor" the attribute information to one of the other
two options. The proportion of participants did change between the two
anchoring alternatives.

The main thrust of the argument here is that given a single option,
participants average across attribute to create a "score" for the job
offer. However given a direct comparison of two offers, participants
take a difference between the two competing alternatives on each
attribute, and add up the number of wins on each attribute.

### Relevance to my work

This method of assessing the strategy for consolidating information
about job offers has obvious links to my methods of applying SFT to
consumer choices in a discrete choice experiment setting. The context
(job offers vs product/service purchases) is slightly different, but the
comparison between multiple options differing along a set of attributes
falls neatly into the multi-attribute choice framework. Some more thought
is warranted on how they have come up with the conclusion based on what
seems to be very limited data.
