## My Thoughts

How does attention effect choice, particularly preferential choice? Whilst there has been a growing shift in the literature to assume the effect of attention on preferences, and ultimately choice, it is still a debated topic.

Recent efforts such as the [[attentional drift diffusion model|aDDM]] from [[Ian Krajbich]] and company tightly link gaze, and fixations, in eye tracking to the eventual choice of participants. Here [[Roopali Bhatnagar]] and [[Jacob L. Orquin]] assess the evidence from a large number of published papers. Their criteria for papers were ones that had some manipulation of attention that did **not** effect the salience of the stimuli and looked at choice that were based on the preference of the participants.

One issue with this meta-analysis is the vast range of possible stimuli, techniques for manipulating gaze duration and more. Given that range, the number of factors that could influence choices was not able to be teased apart due to the relatively low numbers of published papers that met their guidelines.

>While these studies demonstrate an effect of attention on choice, it is difficult to attribute the observed effect entirely to attention, as the experimental manipulations in some of these studies interfere with the choice process either by altering the stimuli properties or by creating value expectations or response biases [(p. 2266)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3JV5AJGL?page=2266&annotation=3NKSXYX6)

>[!quote|#ff6666]
>The gaze cascade hypothesis has not been formulated in mathematical terms, and some aspects of the model therefore remains vague, for instance, on the nature of the decision threshold, the relative effect of attention on preference vs preference on attention, or whether the effect of attention on preference is additive or multiplicative depending on preexisting preferences for a choice option.

>In some studies, the decision maker may, for instance, continue to fixate the location of the option that has been removed thereby continuing evidence accumulation for that option (Weilbächer et al., 2021). Under this assumption, the aDDM does predict an effect of the last fixation. [(p. 2267)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3JV5AJGL?page=2267&annotation=EDIJNZNU)
