## My Thoughts

The case for [[Active Information Search]], by Huber et al. Really focuses on how the standard experimental setup of choices between discrete options with all relevant information displayed does not necessarily translate to real world decision making, so they introduce two [[naturalistic risky choice]] scenarios where either a complete information description, or a short description followed by a period of free interaction where the participant can ask questions in search of new information about the task at hand. Each verbalisation is then categorised according to a predefined scheme relating to the type of information they are requesting or discussing.

>increasing concern about the relevance of these results for natural decisions and the applicability of the SEU-model and its descendants such as Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) in natural decision situations.

>Precise probabilities were mentioned solely in the CPI condition when precise probabilities were supplied, in the other combinations of conditions not one single subject had such an item. These results show that CPI - which is the standard method of information presentation in experiments on risky decisions encourages the use of probability. [(p. 25)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LQ2AEJQF?page=25&annotation=E5FXFSK5)

>If probability information is presented, subjects tend to use it, if the experimenter does not present it, most people are not interested. [(p. 25)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LQ2AEJQF?page=25&annotation=GKB8XL5W)

>[!note]
>What would happen if the presented scenarios were more closely related to traditional risky gambles, for example would people ask for precise probabilities more if the scenario was a horse race?
