## My Thoughts

An interesting investigation into the different effects of uncertainty and novelty on the exploration behaviour of participants participating in a [[reinforcement learning]] task.

There are some variations on the standard [[Q-learning]] model here that may be suitable for review - but there is no direct link to my work on the [[Hypatia Health|Hypatia Health beta]].

>However, one recent study developed a new two-armed bandit task that allowed for separating the uncertainty and novelty of options and found that both impacted decision-making differently (Cockburn et al., 2022). [(p. 148)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TS273HT8?page=148&annotation=2AUYDTN3)

>Given that controllability is a core aspect of learned helplessness (Maier & Seligman, 2016), in which an agent demonstrates a lack of exploration and deficits in learning in a new environment, controllability is likely to have a confounding effect on exploration.

>We determined the sample size to detect a small effect size for the possible within-participant differences in the estimated parameters of computational models between the high reward and low reward conditions. [(p. 148)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TS273HT8?page=148&annotation=WAJGJY7D)
