## My Thoughts

This preprint provides some nice [[model comparison]] using metrics like [[AIC]], but also model [[exceedance probability]] as a way of determining which of the main four models described best representes performance in a [[reinforcement learning]] task.

The RL task involved three distributions for rewards (from three options). Only two options were displayed on the screen at each trial, and two of the options had a standard gaussian distribution for the reward value. The third option (with the medium mean reward) actually generated rewards from a bimodal distribution is add the idea of suprising events to the given rewards.

To model this a standard [[Rescorla-Wagna]] RL model, plus variations that added _uncertainty_, _valence_ and the main aim of the study a learning rate modified by the _suprise_ amount of the absolute [[prediction error]].

>Following best practices as specified by Wilson and Collins (2019) we quantitatively assessed the model fitting process by conducting full model and parameter recovery (see supplementary material) [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F4GCQT4R?page=14&annotation=E486VKPQ)

>However, we also found substantial between-participant variation in model fits, and analyses of the Surprise modelâ€™s parameters did not show any age differences related to the influence of surprising outcomes in low-mid trials evident in the behavioral analyses.

>Recently, another body of work modeled the influece of extreme/surprising events on decisions using sequential sampling tasks (Spitzer, Waschke, & Summerfield, 2017; von Clarenau, Pachur, & Spitzer, 2022) which are more closely connected to the kind of instantaneous trial-by-trial updating we investigated in this study.
