# Process tracing methods: Contributions, problems, and neglected research questions

Ford, J. K., Schmitt, N., Schechtman, S. L., Hults, B. M., & Doherty, M. L. (1989). Process tracing methods: Contributions, problems, and neglected research questions. _Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes_, _43_(1), 75â€“117.

## My Thoughts

This is a great, yet old, summary of the growing field of process tracing research into multi-attribute decision making.

Some important points highlighted below show that in Ford's opinion, too much process tracing research looks only at [[compensatory]] vs [[non-compensatory]] processing. Also mentioned is the focus in [[process tracing]] at the pre-decisional behaviour.

I think this provides some good motivation for a lot of my work, I just wonder whether there is any newer reviews of similar nature.

>Two methodologically distinct yet potentially complementary approaches developed to study underlying cognitive processes are structural or statistical modeling and process modeling (Abelson & Levi, 1985; Einhom, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979; Svenson, 1979). Structural models focus on describing the relation between information stimuli (input) and decision responses (outcomes) (Abelson & Levi, 1985).

>Unfortunately, the large amount of research using process tracing to study task effects has not led (with the possible exception of task complexity) to the cumulation of knowledge necessaryto begin the development of a taxonomy of task characteristics which have been found to have predictable effects on strategy use.

>Certainly, results at this level of specificity are easier to report and to cumulate across studies. Nevertheless, this reporting practice may also reflect the difficulty researchershave in reliably coding responsesto clearly distinguish between the various strategies [(p. 104)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VQSJ2MRU?page=104&annotation=H2RWWBJX)
