>Box 7. Preferential Choice and Value-Based Decision Making Diffusion models have been applied to complex preferential choice applications from judgment and decision making that apply to economics and consumer behavior. Wiener and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion models have been applied to preferential choice, value-based decisions, and economic decisions for more than 25 years. The tasks in these applications are not simple speeded decisions, but rather choices between risky gambles or multiattribute consumer products. Initial work on preferential choice was carried out using what is called decision field theory (DFT) [201]. In this model, a decision maker's attention switches from one attribute to another over time, and the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative are accumulated into a preference state. When one option reaches a decision threshold, that choice is taken. DFT has been used to fit choice and RT data from choices between risky and uncertain gambles [201]. Later, a multialternative version of DFT was used to account for the context effects (similarity, attraction, compromise effects) on choice found by consumer researchers [181]. In related research, Tsetsos et al. [202] used the leaky competing accumulator diffusion model to predict context effects on choice. DFT has also been used to account for puzzling reversals in preference between choice and price of gambles [203] and to explain choice and RTs for intertemporal choice [204]. Recent research on value-based decision making has used the attention drift diffusion model [205,206]. The model assumes that attention to an option changes the drift rate during preference accumulation. Novel eye tracking methods have been used to track attention to options across time and use these measurements to moderate the drift rate across time. This model has achieved impressive success to account for eye fixation data as well as both choice and RT distributions for choices between food items. This and other diffusion models have been used to account for, among other things, value-based decision, social choice, and purchasing decisions [150,152,153,157,207–210].
