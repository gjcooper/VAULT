## My Thoughts

A fantastic use of large scale real world data in cognitive modelling. By using purchasing data from a large-scale retailer and looking at sequential choices, primarily through the search functionality on the website Hornsby and Love were able to test predictions of an associative memory model that in the end had the best predictions when using [[hierarchical relationships]], [[semantic relationships]], and [[episodic relationships]] between the successive items in the shopping carts.
