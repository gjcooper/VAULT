# The standard relationship between choice frequency and choice time is violated in multi-attribute preferential choice

The standard relationship between choice frequency and choice time is violated in multi-attribute preferential choice. _Journal of Mathematical Psychology_, _115_, 102775.

## My Thoughts

Yay, a dataset from my PhD has been published here in the context of an article posing the question of whether EAM's are inadequate at predicting both choice and choice time in multi-attribute preferential choice. A special issue of JMP for [[Anthony Marley|Tony Marley]], based on conversations [[Guy Hawkins]] has had with Tony about the **c**

>Theoretically, it permits testing the principle of sequential sampling as a foundational unit of the decision process — units that can be pieced together much like atoms making up a molecule. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BGAWEKIM?page=2&annotation=DCR592YN)

>In low-level decisions, we almost always observe a monotonically decreasing relationship between choice frequency and choice times, conditioned on a given threshold/boundary. [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BGAWEKIM?page=3&annotation=RQSLGZD8)

>For instance, Yang and Krajbich (2023) investigated value-based decisions between two options each with two defined features, and found that attention switching (eye movements) led to discounted weights (lower utility) for the non-fixated attribute and non-fixated option. Discounted weights for non-attended information will attenuate the relationship between choice frequency and choice time [(p. 11)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BGAWEKIM?page=11&annotation=2R5SZ4TT)
