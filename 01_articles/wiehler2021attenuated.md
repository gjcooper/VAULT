## My Thoughts

This is a nice resource for the [[Hypatia Health]] I am doing as it outlines several [[reinforcement learning]] models, including the simple [[Q-learning]] model I have already implemented and other potential models including the [[Kalman Filter|Bayesian Learner]] model.

'm not particularly interested in the [[fMRI]] content here, and the model comparison isn't particularly interesting - especially as the model with the most parameters gets the best fit

>In total, our model space therefore consisted of five models: (1) Qlearning model with softmax, (2) Bayesian learner with softmax, (3) Bayesian learner with softmax and exploration bonus, (4) Bayesian learner with softmax and perseveration bonus, and (5) Bayesian learner with softmax, exploration bonus and perseveration bonus.

>All models were fitted using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation in Stan version 2.18.1 (Carpenter et al., 2017) with separate group-level normal distributions for gamblers and controls for each choice parameter (b, w, and r), from which individual-participant parameters were drawn.
