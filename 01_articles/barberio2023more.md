>The Common Item probes were used to link the current dataset to past datasets (see Results for linking procedure). The Common Item probes were only used to link datasets, and the data was discarded before data analysis addressing the current research questions.

>To assess the fit of the weaker model, we calculated a Linear Mixed Model with slope and intercepts as random effects (marginal R2 = 0.16, and the BIC = 60693). Neither the estimated random intercepts, t(89) = 0.30, p = 0.75, nor the estimated random slopes, t(89) = 0.56, p = 0.57, significantly differed from 0, indicating that the fixed value slope and intercept were appropriate. Finally, when the model was fit to individual participants the resulting R2 values were significantly above zero (Median = 0.32), s = 67, p < 0.001. To assess the fit of the strong model, we calculated a Linear Mixed Model with slope and intercepts as random effects (marginal R2 = 0.15, and the BIC = 60885). Neither the estimated random intercepts, t(89) = 0.06, p = 0.94, nor the estimated random slopes, t(89) = 0.71, p = 0.48, significantly differed from 0, indicating that the fixed value slope and intercept were appropriate. Finally, when the model was fit to individual participants the resulting R2 values were significantly above zero (Median = 0.31), s = 69, p < 0.001.

>Stimuli were all people that range from very low Psychological Value (e.g., a terrorist, a rapist, a pedophile, an assassin) to very high Psychological Value (e.g., a mother, an astronaut, a soldier). [(p. 33)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PPZBHJA?page=33&annotation=ZFC249MP)

>The masked decision scenario allowed participants to read the decision scenario, however, the probes were masked with asterisks (see Figure 4). Thus, participants understood the question but could not determine how they would respond. Finally, the probes were unmasked.

>Therefore, an overlap of 0.7 becomes an overlap of 0.5, thus increasing the distance between the Psychological Value distributions of the two-person group and the single person group (see Figure 8, the first row of the top section). In contrast, for the condition HVO1LVO2, the overlap should be increased 0.2 units relative to the overlap that was input.
