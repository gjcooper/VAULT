# Logical-rule models of classification response times: A synthesis of mental-architecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches.

## My Thoughts

A synthesis of ideas from [[Systems Factorial Technology]], exemplar-based [[Categorisation]], al la [[nosofsky2011generalized]], and some [[random-walk]] or [[diffusion decision model]] approaches to categorisation and response times.

I like the approach of determining some qualititative predictions of the models, and then assessing those predictions in the light on data that has been acquired.

One point of difference and the approaches I have been looking at with say the models of processing in my veridical modelling ([[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice|veridical choice modelling paper]]), or the exemplar models of consumer choice ([[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|EB-CCM]]) is that there are _few_ people, with multiple long sessions of data acquisition per person. My methods have been tailored more towards a single shorter session, with more people, and then using [[hierarchical modelling]] approaches to leverage responses from multiple people in order to get more signal to noise, but not miss too much individual variation.

>One approach has focused on alternative mental architectures of information processing (e.g., Kantowitz, 1974; Schweickert, 1992; Sternberg, 1969; Townsend, 1984). [(p. 310)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BWQDP5D7?page=310&annotation=W8WL9JCH)

>To provide a process interpretation for this hypothesis, and to improve comparability among alternative models, Nosofsky and Stanton (2005) proposed a random-walk version of decision-bound theory that implements the RT-distance hypothesis (see also Ashby, 2000). We refer to the model as the RW-DFB (random-walk distance-from-boundary) model [(p. 317)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BWQDP5D7?page=317&annotation=YKSMG5KZ)

>A second comparison model is the exemplar-based randomwalk (EBRW) model (Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1997a, 1997b; Nosofsky & Stanton, 2005), which is a highly successful exemplar-based model of classification. [(p. 318)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BWQDP5D7?page=318&annotation=GLTSFIER)

>Furthermore, there is much evidence that shifting spatial attention takes time (e.g., Sperling & Weichselgartner, 1995). [(p. 326)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BWQDP5D7?page=326&annotation=NW8QFYKK)
