## My Thoughts

Last piece read for my [[UNSW Job Talk]]. More of a review articles linking the [[attentional capture]] work to addiction, psychopathology and more general decision making. A significant portion talks about how attentional control might influence the [[attentional drift diffusion model]] and similar models of decision making that take attention into account.

>At any given moment, there is a huge number of potential choices available, and carefully weighing up the pros and cons of each would rapidly multiply beyond the capacity of human decision-making. [(p. 320)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZDCD989?page=320&annotation=BHILTZLG)

>Physically salient stimuli can be automatically selected by the attention system when selection is not intended, a phenomenon known as ‘attentional capture’. [(p. 321)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZDCD989?page=321&annotation=VW7G79HY)

>Many different types of experience contribute to selection history (for a review, see ref.43). [(p. 321)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZDCD989?page=321&annotation=Q9F2IG3F)

>This finding suggests that top-down executive control processes can reduce capture if sufficient resources are available. Participants also show decreased vmAC when under low working memory load relative to higher load, suggesting that capture by reward-related distractors can be suppressed by top-down control [(p. 324)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZDCD989?page=324&annotation=K8A5CG63)

>Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism that underlies motivated suppression and to reveal the conditions necessary for complete suppression of vmAC. [(p. 324)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZDCD989?page=324&annotation=ICCXSVLS)
