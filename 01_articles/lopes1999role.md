## My Thoughts

Some interesting discussion here on the contrasting approaches of [[utility]] or rational approaches typically taken by economists when looking at risky decision making, when compared to the more psychological approach of trying to understand actual human behaviour. The theories used by psychologists such as [[Cumulative Prospect Theory]] and the argued for [[Security-Potential - Aspiration Model|SP/A model]].

Fitting the models to data was done via way of Microsoft Solver, but upon further reading that was just a way to minimised [[RMSD]] between the model fit and the data, which could easily be done many other ways. The approach here is a low number of trial repeats (indeed no repeats in Experiment 2) so getting subject specific fits would be next to impossible. This gives little direct applicability to my work.

>In a nutshell, the expected utility model asserts that when people choose between alternative probability distributions over outcomes (i.e., lotteries or gambles), they should (the economic model) and do (the psychological model) make their choices so as to maximize a probability weighted (i.e., linear) average of the outcome utilities.

>In cumulative prospect theory (CPT), Tversky 6 Kahneman (1992) reformulated the original prospect theory in terms of (de)cumulative weighted utility. The utility function, u(v), was unchanged from the original, being concave (risk averse) for gains and convex (risk seeking) for losses, with the loss function assumed to be steeper than the gain function (*>1):  u(v)={v:  & *( &v ) ;  if v 0  if v<0.

>For present purposes, we treat the aspiration level as crisp, which is to say, a discrete value that either is or is not satisfied. In principle, however, the aspiration level may be fuzzy: some outcomes may satisfy the aspiration level completely, others to a partial degree, and still others not at all. To model this, Eq. (11) would need to incorporate a particular probability, pi , according to the degree that its associated outcome, vi , satisfies the aspiration level (Oden 6 Lopes, 1997).

>Most economists view their discipline as one that deals with ideally rational behavior and, thus, attach little significance to discrepancies between what the theory predicts and what people actually do. Psychologists, on the other hand, view their task as one of predicting behavior and describing its cognitive sources in psychologically meaningful terms, whether or not that behavior is rational.
