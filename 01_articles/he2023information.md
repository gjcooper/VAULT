## My Thoughts

A nice collection of many models of [[intertemporal choice]], that is choices between payoffs now or in the short term as compared to payoffs further in the future. They included models in the general category of [[delay-discounting]] models, as well as those they classified as [[time-as-attribute]] models.

All of the models seemed to do a good job of explaining the data, with some winning out over others but with no major misfits.

The more important contribution would be the attention model they develop, which does makes predictions about the attention processes that in turn makes predictions about the best fitting intertemporal choice model.
