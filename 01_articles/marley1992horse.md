## My Thoughts

I find this paper really difficult to read, lots of theorems and proofs. Need practice with that. Might want to come back to it.

>Nonetheless, we see in the next section that it is not in general possible to represent a dependent “horse race” random utility model by some equivalent independent “horse race” random utility model-at least, not if the independent random variables are associated directly with the elements of S.

>Intuitively, the proportionality of the hazard rates means that the time of choice gives no information as to the identity of the choice option, and vice-versa. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W69DZWPT?page=10&annotation=H77C5PSI)

>THEOREM 2. Consider an independent horse race random utility model (S, P) where for each x E X E S, Px(x; t) is absolutely continuous and positive for all t > 0 and Px(x) is nonzero. Zf the option chosen, C(X), is independent of the time of choice, T(X), then the choice probabilities satisfy Lute’s choice model. [(p. 11)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W69DZWPT?page=11&annotation=9M2DQ98I)

>Although this latter class includes many common models such as Lute’s choice model (see earlier), the independence of the option chosen and the time of choice is probably too strong for most data. [(p. 17)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W69DZWPT?page=17&annotation=VIQ6FP4I)
