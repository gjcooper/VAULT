## My Thoughts

Decision making research done old school. The [[pattern analysis]] here was interesting, looking at choice patterns across a few experiments and using them to initially shw evidence against participants using an [[optimal stopping rule]]. This was then followed by a discussion of a number of alternative stopping strategies for the deferred decision making. Each of these previously described stopping strategies were also shown to be violated by patterns evident in the data. Finally a myopic stopping rule strategy was described that did the best at explaining participants data with fewer disconfirming patterns.

>The log posterior odds after purchasing n observations equals the sum of the log odds, s(O) + s( 1) + s(2) + . . . + s(n), where s(O) represents the log of the prior odds. Previous research on probabilistic inference using tasks similar to the present one supports the additive rule for combining evidence (Shanteau, 1970; Wallsten and Sapp, 1977).

The shortsighted nature of this stopping rule allows one to wastefully purchase o [(p. 122)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GI2KJBFH?page=122&annotation=AYDCRF4M)
