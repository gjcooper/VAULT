## My Thoughts

A seminal paper on the [[Conjunctive Strategy]], the [[Disjunctive Strategy]] and the [[compensatory]] strategy (most similar perhaps to the canonical compensatory model - the [[Weighted Additive Rule]])

There is a lot of dense (and frankly obscure) mathematical here that hearken to the math intro on [[Mathematical Spaces]] I started working through.

>Method of Single Stimuli. Relative data contain information about one  stimulus in relation to another, e.g., which of two candidates is preferred, which of two grays is brighter. Irrelative data contain information about a stimulus in an absolute sense, e.g., an individual passes an  arithmetic item, he endorses candidate X, he says how loud the noise is.

>Both these models were first introduced in psychological literature by H. M. Johnson (13), who speaks of the logical product and the logical sum, which correspond, respectively, to the conjunctive and disjunctive models described here.

> Tis idea of a [[genotypic space]] where individuals and stimuli are represented as vectors within this space is interesting and has links to the [[psychological space]].
