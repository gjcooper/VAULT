## My Thoughts

Some nice overview work here i this review work for my work on the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]] use in Chapter 4 of my [[thesis]]. In particular there is a nice introduction to geometrical [[psychological space]]'s which represent object in N-dimensional metric spaces, typically [[Euclidean space]]'s, but newer directions have extended this to [[Non-euclidean space]]'s.

Of particular note are two work by [[Bradley C. Love]] and colleagues on the use of psychological space in [[consumer choice]] settings.

>Three popular data structures include geometric spaces, set-theoretic spaces, and graph spaces. Each of the three types of data sources (stimulus, neural, behavioral) can be transformed into any one of the three psychological spaces (Figure 1) [(p. 220)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKDZMJT5?page=220&annotation=FN6XUR4Z)

>Historically, when referring specifically to the free parameters that correspond to the representation of stimuli (e.g., coordinates in geometric space), inference algorithms were commonly called multidimensional scaling (MDS), or simply scaling, algorithms [(p. 222)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKDZMJT5?page=222&annotation=WVPJMP9U)

>When modeling identification and categorization performance, the entire process can be framed as a mapping from stimulus representation X (e.g., image pixels) to a categorical outcome y. Given stimulus i, the probability of responding identity/category j is denoted by p( y j|Xi, 2), where 2 is a catchall for any model parameters.

>A popular behavior module comes from the similarity choice model (SCM) (Luce 1963, Shepard 1957), which is sometimes referred to as Luce’s ratio of strengths formulation (Luce 1959). The heart of SCM is the response rule  P( y j|i, Z, b) = b js(zi, z j )  ∑N  k=1 bks(zi, zk ) [(p. 223)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKDZMJT5?page=223&annotation=J3LIJUUZ)

>The complete fusing of a lookup table (perception module) and SCM (behavior module) is demonstrated by the MDS-choice model (Shepard 1957, 1958). An MDS-choice model explicitly infers a psychological space by assuming similarity is functionally related to psychological distance via an exponential-family kernel,  s(zi, z j  ) = exp(−β||zi − z j||τ  ρ  ), 7.  where β, ρ, and τ control the gradient of generalization. The steepness at which similarity decays is largely controlled by β. The most common settings of τ result in a Laplace kernel (τ = 1) and a Gaussian kernel (τ = 2). The most common settings for the Minkowski distance parameter ρ result in Manhattan distance (ρ = 1) and Euclidean distance (ρ = 2).

>Beyond similarity judgments, psychological spaces can also be derived from real-world activity patterns, such as consumer shopping behavior (Hornsby & Love 2022, Hornsby et al. 2020). [(p. 229)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKDZMJT5?page=229&annotation=9PF8EPZ2)

>In a standard triplet task, a participant is given a query image and two reference images, and they must select the reference image they think is most similar to the query image. This task can be generalized such that a participant is shown a query image and |R| reference images (Roads & Mozer 2019, Wah et al. 2014, Wilber et al. 2014).
