## My Thoughts

Seems like this is where Nosofsky's  work on the [[Generalised Context Model]] began, (taken from his PhD dissertation). Introduces the GCM, as well as the concepts of [[psychological space]], the [[Multidimensional Scaling]].

There is a bit in here about choices for the value of $r$, the [[Minkowski distance metric]], with Nosofsky talking about regular choices of either 2 (Euclidean distance) or 1 (city-block metric), however although the metric is defined initially as r >= 1 it is also stated at one point that r values **less than or equal** to 1 provide the best account of psychological distance relationships.

>In a great deal of research on categorization, the experimenters specify a set of physical dimensions that define the stimuli and then assume that the psychological dimensions match this physical specification. [(p. 43)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JX5ZM86X?page=43&annotation=DX9BPBEQ)

>The support for the Euclidean metric contrasts with the widely held view that for separable-dimension stimuli, values of /• less than or equal to 1 in the Minkowski r-metric formula provide the best account of psychological distance relationships [(p. 44)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JX5ZM86X?page=44&annotation=JL3C6KI4)
