## My Thoughts

This is an interesting look into the supposed U-shaped behavioural responses to a [[reinforcement learning]] paradigm across the adolescent age range. I say "supposed" here as to my naked eye the individual data is very spread out and hard to clearly see a pattern. There is perhaps a pattern in the rolling average responses overlaid on the figures, however even here, while there does seem to be an increase across the you adolescent range, the older adolescent to adult age range may be better described as being flat.

The U-shaped pattern is more evident in the cognitive model parameters for the age band 13-15. However looking at the actual values here show an affective difference of a couple of percentage points (14 down to 12 percent) for the [[bayesian inference]] model parameters, and a difference in the negative outcome learning rate for the [[Q-learning]] model of approximately 0.06 (0.63 down to 0.57).

One very interesting facet that I have taken from this is some work (annotated below) that takes the view that good performers (the adolescents in this case) do not necessarily have better innate learning rates or better matching cognitive models (what they term the _settings_ account) but instead that the adolescents in this (and other cases) perhaps have a better _adaptation_. This adaptation refers to the ability of a group of participants (or individuals) to adjust their behaviour (and presumably their cognitive processes) to better match the demands of the task at hand.

This last suggestion has intriguing possibilities that i will discuss on  the [[Hypatia Health]] project page.

>An abundance of studies has mapped the brain regions and neurotransmitters that support reversal learning (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, basal ganglia; serotonin, dopamine, glutamate; Izquierdo et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2004; Izquierdo and Jentsch, 2012; Frank and Claus, 2006; Hamilton and Brigman, 2015; Kehagia et al., 2010; Yaple and Yu, 2019) [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MDTVGFPG?page=2&annotation=4HLLV96B)

>Behavioral switching only occurs once the previously-rewarding action has accumulated enough negative outcomes to push its value below the previously-unrewarding action. This gradual change may fail to capture the quick and flexible switching behavior observed in humans and non-human animals (Izquierdo et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2015).

>However, many have argued that a different computational framework, BI (specifically, Hidden Markov Models), provides a better model for human and animal behavior in reversal tasks than RL (Gershman and Uchida, 2019; Fuhs and Touretzky, 2007; Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2015; Solway and Botvinick, 2012).

>A recent review (Nussenbaum and Hartley, 2019) showed favorable empirical evidence for the adaptation compared to the settings account, given that specific parameter results often differ widely between studies, while parameter adaptiveness tends to be consistent (also see (Eckstein et al., 2021b,a)).
