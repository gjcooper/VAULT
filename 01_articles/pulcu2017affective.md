## My Thoughts

This variation on a [[volatility]] based [[reinforcement learning]] task has some differences to the "standard" task I have already implemented. Specifically the probability of a win and the probability of a loss are independent, in that any particular option can give a win and loss at the same time and the participant needs to track these probabilities independently in order to respond effeiciently.

This does not seem like too muc of a stretch to implement, and the modelling and visualisation should be simple to follow.

> This is a fairly different task structure to what I already have in the [[Hypatia Work]] so far in that the probability of a win or loss is independant.
