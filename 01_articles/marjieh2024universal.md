## My Thoughts

I love this. Raja et. al. use a large corpus of naturalistic stimuli to test [[Shepard]]'s [[Universal law of generalisation]] - extending the support for this law from simple low-dimensional stimuli to complex naturalistic stimuli.

There are some comparison tests with other models for the relationship between similarity (or generalisation) ratings and distance functions, but mostly this is a lovely take on extending prior work utilising methods like online testing of a large collection of participants, large collections of open access image data and powerful computing for data analysis.

One avenue that I'd be interested in pursuing that was inspired by this work would be something like [[Feature Selection for Similarity Judgements of Naturalistic Stimuli]]. I note in particular that for the MDS solution for animals some interpretable clusters of stimuli were found (carnivores, mammals, etc). However, for the vegetables and fruits the MDS space showed a more continuous array of stimuli, leading the authors to indicate that perhaps colour or some other continuous-like stimuli feature was being used as the basis for the similarity ratings.

What would the space look like when averaged over multiple people if they are using different featural dimensions in order to make the ratings??
