## My Thoughts

A fairly simple set of studies from Ami et. al. that run the typical [[Stroop]] task with congruent and incongruent trial, alongside another version of the task where people were "forced" to read every word. This forced reading of the word was done by telling participants to refrain from responding if there word was not a colour word (Bed instead of Red). The non-colour words were selected to be similar (sharing most characters) to force reading in order to achieve the required successful no-go rates.

The main point of this reading for journal club was to illustrate the idea that no matter what we think participants are doing, we can never be sure. The predominant assumption with the stroop is that the reading of the words was an automatic process that override the instruction to ignore the word content. However the stroop effect increases significantly once the words are forced to be read.

The interpretation most favoured by the authors is that perhaps a certain proportion of the time (say 80%) the participants successfully inhibit the reading of the words, and thus incongruent and congruent trial response times should be identical. However if they do read the words on the remaining times then the stroop effect takes hold.
