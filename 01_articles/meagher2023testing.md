# Testing formal cognitive models of classification and old-new recognition in a real-world high-dimensional category domain

## My Thoughts

The 3 large categories in use here are not as homogenous as other more artificial categories might be in the research. How does this relate to more typical category learning? An OK? test of [[exemplar]] models of categorical decision making as compared to [[prototype theory]] or the [[clustering model]] of [[Categorisation]].

The work on old-new recognition is a nice extension of the categorisation models, and provides an interesting test. However I am a little unsure about the use of different model fits to both phases of the study (ie diff parameter estimates depending on the response/task types). It seems to me a better test would be the use of say stage 1 par estimates to predict responses in stage 2, or some type of joint model approach.

I also appreciate the [[hybrid-similarity exemplar model]], which [[Robert M Nosofsky|Nosofsky]] discussed at [[Psychonomics 2023]]. It seems a nice approach.

>By comparison, for numerous other types of real-world categories, the learning process has already taken place outside of the lab, and the specific training examples that learners have experienced during their lifetimes are unknown.
