## My Thoughts

This is a nice piece showing the benefits of an appropriately applied cognitive model as opposed to a more statistical/descriptive approach. To start with they argue that with an appropriate parametrisation a [[Multialternative Decision Field Theory]] could better explain decisions as opposed to two [[Random Utility Model]]'s, the [[probit]] and the [[Multinomial Logit Models|logit]] models.

In two studies they first show that the MDFT does not provide greater predictive power as ooposed to the RUM's when working with standard choice sets, although the log-likelihood of the MDFT is better. However in study 2 when the choice sets were augmented to show the relatively common [[context effects]], like [[Similarity]], then the MDFT outperforms the other models for a majority of participants.

>Perhaps the two most prominent and widely used RUMs are the (multinomial) logit and probit models (e.g., Daganzo, 1980; Hausman & Wiese, 1978; Luce, 1959; McFadden, 1973; Thurstone, 1927). Both models have a long success record and are frequently applied in economics, psychology, consumer research, and related fields, including the domains of travel behavior [(p. 1331)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HKMV45Y2?page=1331&annotation=CFHKSBBB)

>At the same time, a growing body of literature inside and outside psychology promotes the application of cognitive process models to better understand and predict choice behavior (e.g., Chandukala et al., 2007; Otter et al., 2008; Reutskaja et al., 2011).
