## My Thoughts

This theory is quite complicated and I like the way the _thought processes_ behind it are built up from prior simpler models like [[Random Utility Model]]s and [[Sequential sampling models]]. I still got a bit lost and perhaps a reread of some of the evidence outlined may be worthwhile in the future.

There are some useful links here to violations of the assumptions of simpler expected utility models, and I like the framework of discussing [[Decision field Theory]] in the context of [[deterministic vs stochastic choice|deterministic vs probabilistic]] choice and [[static vs dynamic choices]].

>Static theories are silent concerning these lawful relationships. Although static theorists might argue that deliberation time is a separate issue and that preference can be studied independent of deliberation time, these assumptions turn out to be empirically false.

>The overall picture that emerges from a large number of decision-making experiments (see Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1992) indicates that decision makers do in fact trade off accuracy (e.g., average payoff) for effort (e.g., decision time) [(p. 435)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JESYGVXE?page=435&annotation=P2VC5LQB)

>These basic facts rule out static models of decision making, including random utility models, and point to the need for dynamic accounts of how preferences change over time. [(p. 435)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JESYGVXE?page=435&annotation=W2T58NWH)

>Savage (1954) originally proposed a prescriptive version of SEU theory in which the subjective probabilities obeyed the laws of mathematical probability theory. Later, Edwards (1962) proposed a descriptive version of SEU theory with subjective probability weights that do not obey the laws of mathematical probability theory. Numerous other variations of descriptive SEU theory have followed that retain many of the same basic characteristics (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky's, 1979, prospect theory).

>Thus, probability of choosing action AR over AL is /V(AR, AL) = Pr[P> 0] = Pr[t > -d]. The above choice model is mathematically related to a class of choice models known as random utility models (see Colonius, 1984).

>In sum, by including a sequential sampling process into random SEU theory, sequential SEU theory provides a mechanism for explainingthe fundamental speed-accuracy or cost-benefit trade-off relations frequently observed in decision making.
