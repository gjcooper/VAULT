## My Thoughts

A purely economic paper that proposes a psychological reason behind the observed increase in cosmetic (lipstick) purchasing during the [[Great Recession]] (2007-2009). Alternative theories state that increased cosmetic purchases were in order to attain (or hold onto) jobs for economic security, or to attract a mate for the same reasons. However the psychological theory (which admittedly has been discussed anecdotally before) is that women switch from luxury purchases of items such as clothes during periods of economic hardship to equally luxury - but relatively cheaper categories such as cosmetics.
