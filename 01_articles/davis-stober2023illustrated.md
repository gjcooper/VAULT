# An illustrated guide to context effects

Davis-Stober, C. P., Marley, A. A. J., McCausland, W. J., & Turner, B. M. (2023). An illustrated guide to context effects. _Journal of Mathematical Psychology_, _115_, 102790. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2023.102790](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2023.102790)

## My Thoughts

I mist admit a lot of this goes over my head and might need to be revisited if I work in context effects areas. There are some great examples of individual effects not being represented in aggregate measures that may be useful for a citation in my [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper.

Overall I would say this is a great resource to be revisited if I need to work in [[context effects]].

>we will show below that it is possible for the RCS of each individual in a population to satisfy a context effect and not the RCS for the population, and vice versa. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9JW2L8E8?page=6&annotation=6A3HB2S2)

>Often, however, the similarity, between-ness and dominance relations are derived relations, objectively defined in terms of a deeper structure on the master set. Very often, this deeper structure consists of an attribute space. Choice object are identified with vectors, points in a Euclidean space of finite dimension I. Each dimension is an attribute (such as price) of a single indivisible choice object and the value of the corresponding element of the vector is an attribute level (such as 10 dollars).

>One of the inequalities that the weak similarity effect associates with this precondition is PT (z)/PT (y) > pzy/pyz . However, one of the inequalities the weak compromise effect associates with the precondition x|y|z is PT (z)/PT (y) < pzy/pyz . Clearly the two inequalities cannot both be satisfied.

>Caution is recommended when making claims relating individual and population weak binaryâ€“ternary effects. The occurrence of an aggregate effect, even if two-sided, does not imply the existence of even one individual with even a one-sided effect: Fig. 7 gives a counterexample.
