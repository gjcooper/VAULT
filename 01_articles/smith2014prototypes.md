## My Thoughts

An interesting approach of looking at the debate between prototype and exemplar models of [[Categorisation]] not as a question of what better fits the data, but what approaches do better with different types of categorisation tasks. The prototype model seems to achive better correct responses for a lot of tasks, especially family resemblance types categorisations where the dimensions of each category act like a multivariate gaussian, even when not linearly seperable. Only when the structure of the categories is an exclusive-or relationship does the exemplar model win out in any significant fashion.

>In particular, the gamma parameter should not be added to exemplar models to increase their mathematical power. Gamma (derived by Ashby & Maddox, 1993, to serve a specific mathematical purpose) was incorporated by exemplar theorists into their models as part of the process by which the defining assumptions of exemplar theory were relaxed to keep the exemplar model competitive. By these changes, the exemplar model began to lose its theoretical clarity (Maddox & Ashby, 1998). The problem is that gamma can enormously increase the exemplar model’s mathematical complexity (Myung, Pitt, & Navarro, 2007) so that it verges on being the powerful classifier commonly used by professional statisticians (Ashby & Alfonso-Reese, 1995). Thus, the model becomes a mathematical abstraction that cannot be used to differentiate psychological theories. Gamma’s purpose was to sharpen categorization profiles, producing higher highs and lower lows, but it does so for mathematical reasons that do not relate to human or animal psychology (Smith et al., 2008). In addition, by this sharpening, gamma contradicts the fundamental character of exemplar-based geometries (Smith, 2002; Smith & Minda, 2001, 2002): Exemplar categorization profiles are inherently homogeneous because of the softening tendencies of generalization to multiple exemplars. It has even been shown that gamma can let exemplar processes mimic prototype processes (Smith & Minda, 1998). This representational entanglement is a serious problem when one is trying to differentiate these psychological processes.
