## My Thoughts

Whilst this article argues that the optimal allocation of resources for decision making from a larger superset is based on even distribution across a distinct subset. For lower levels of capacity they identify this subset to have a cardinality of 5, for larger capacities this can increase towards 10, but not really beyond it.

They attempt this by running multiple parallel accumulators and measuring the expected utility as they vary the number of sampled accumulators. There may be _something_ here for the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper, as framing for why people would reduce the larger set of options to a smaller subset, but not much else is of relevance.

>In that case, the allocation of resources might be governed by two-stage processes (Hauser & Wernerfelt, 1990; Mehta et al., 2003; Roberts & Lattin, 1991; Shocker, Ben-Akiva, Boccara, & Nedungadi, 1991), instead of purely sequential processes, where the first decision is about the subset of options that will be considered for further processing.
