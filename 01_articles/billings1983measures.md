# Measures of compensatory and noncompensatory models of decision behavior: [[process tracing]] versus policy capturing

Billings, R. S., & Marcus, S. A. (1983). Measures of compensatory and noncompensatory models of decision behavior: Process tracing versus policy capturing. _Organizational Behavior and Human Performance_, _31_(3), 331â€“352. [https://doi.org/10.1016/0030-5073(83)90129-0](https://doi.org/10.1016/0030-5073(83)90129-0)

## My Thoughts

Two approaches dominate the literature, using models such as nonlinear regression, ANOVA or random utility models to infer the relative weights of attribute values on the decision, and process models such as information boards and eye-tracking to infer the decision strategies being employed by participants.

Billings and Marcus try to assess the ability of these two approaches by applying them to the same dataset, and look towards concordance between the approaches. As which much research using process tracing, they investigate whether the decision making is [[compensatory]] vs [[non-compensatory]] (ignoring other aspects of [[decision strategies]])

Definitely focused on decisions between competing alternatives, varying number of options from 2-12, and a counterbalanced order of information board vs rating task (not a preference between alternatives, ie not DCE like).

Just noting this

>When a subject is faced with a moderate to large number of alternatives, the strategy seems to be to eliminate alternatives quickly. Accordingly, noncompensatory strategies are used and a variable search pattern is produced as alternatives are eliminated when a cutoff is not met.
