## My Thoughts

The focus here is very much not *process tracing*, but there is a little here about the relationship between visual attention and attribute value being a small part of the drivers for visual attention. The relative cost of

>More generally Orquin and Muller Loose (2013) summarise the literature on attention and eye movements as follows: 1) eye-movements during decision making are controlled both by top down and bottom up processes, 2) learning significantly influences the speed and accuracy of fixations, 3) decision makers trade-off between fixations and working memory, and 4) fixated information influences decision making more than non-fixated information.

if extreme value for examples of DCE and eye tracking.  
  
largely focused on whether eye tracking is useful for determining attribute influence on consumer choice, but ends with three possibility of it being useful for process information.  
  
The Bayesian infinite logit model introduced seems interesting, and when I have more time I would like to look into it further.
