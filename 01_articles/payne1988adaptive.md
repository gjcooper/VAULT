## My Thoughts

([Payne et al., 1988](zotero://select/library/items/J6NXA9ZE)) introduces measurements for cognitive effort and accuracy of a range of different decision making strategies. These measurements are achieved by breaking each decision strategy into component processes, and combinations of these are simulated to investigate the effort and choices. These component process include reading information, computation (addition of attribute values and weighting values), moving attention and the final choice.

Simulations of 10 different decision strategies used in the context of risky choice under multiple levels of task complexity (numbers of attributes and alternatives) and multiple levels of time pressure, where time constraint was controlled by a maximum number of the component processes. Follow up experiments show that on measures of variances in time spent on attributes and alternative, and relative differences between attribute and alternative based processing people are choosing to use different strategies at different levels of time pressure.

All component processes are assumed to take an equivalent amount of time which seems unlikely however application of times from ([Bettman et al., 1990](zotero://select/library/items/B6QJXSF5)) did not substantially change the prediction from the simulations., and the time to select a strategy is not taken into account.
