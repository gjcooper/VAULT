# Elimination by aspects: A theory of choice

Tversky, A. (1972). Elimination by aspects: A theory of choice. _Psychological Review_, _79_(4), 281â€“299. [https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032955](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032955)

## My Thoughts

Some more detail on the model can be found in my note [[Elimination by Aspect Strategy]]. Here [[Tversky]] outlines the model in detail, providing proofs of certain properties and special cases of the model.

I was particularly taken by Tversky's suggestion to combine with eye movements or reaction time, and there are perhaps interesting threads to follow on [[Multidimensional Scaling]]. For a highly mathematical treatise on a new model, it actually is rather nice to read.

>Models of this type are called random utility models. The only random utility models which have been seriously investigated assume that the random variables are independent. [(p. 284)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53FABXLK?page=284&annotation=YHT5CKPY)

>The study of the actual strategies employed by subjects in choice experiments may perhaps be advanced by investigating choice probabilities in conjunction with other data such as reaction time, eye movements, or verbal protocols.

>Research on multidimensional scaling based on similarity, or proximity, data (e.g., Shepard, 1964a; Torgerson, 1965) has also shown that judgments of unitary and composite stimuli (sometimes referred to as analyzable and unanalyzable) are governed by different rules.

>In general, therefore, the strategy of elimination by aspects cannot be defended as a rational procedure of choice. On the other hand, there may be many contexts in which it provides a good approximation to much more complicated compensatory models and could thus serve as a useful simplification procedure.
