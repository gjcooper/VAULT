## My Thoughts

Sequential decisions is not my jam, so this may need to be revisited when I have context. A nice use though of the [[diffusion decision model|DDM]] to look at answering the question as to whether you can separate the effect of increasing switch value (the value increases in this games trial by trial), choice conflict (the utility of switching vs staying is more difficult to determine), escalating risks (the longer you play the riskier) or just the number of trials performed in a sequence.
