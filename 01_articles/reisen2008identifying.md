>Svenson (1979) concluded that it is “gradually becoming clear that human decision making cannot be understood simply by studying final decisions” (p. 86) [(p. 641)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=641&annotation=8CDJGU5V)

>Frequently used methods within this paradigm are information boards (e.g., Payne, 1976; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993), verbal protocols (e.g., Ericsson & Simon, 1984), the recording of eye movements (e.g., Lohse & Johnson, 1996; Russo & Leclerc, 1994; Russo & Rosen, 1975), and the method of [[Active Information Search ]](AIS; Huber, Wider, & Huber, 1997).

>After the participants in both conditions had completed the selection of the attributes — their final set of attributes is henceforth referred to as the selected attributes — they ranked these attributes with respect to their importance. They were informed that in the next phase the attribute they considered most important would appear on the top and the one they considered least important on the bottom of the information board. Moreover, participants in both conditions were informed that, once this ranking was complete, they could not access any information other than that concerning the selected attributes.

>In general, two types of strategies could be identified: elimination strategies and additive strategies. [(p. 646)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=646&annotation=TBZXBHMM)

>About a third of the participants (10 of 31) used Just-Noticeable-Differences when eliminating alternatives [(p. 647)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=647&annotation=5L5629XU)

> I like this approach of figuring out predictions for choices from - in my case the random effects and trial data for that participant. I kind of do this with the simulated data from the subjects median RE values for each strategy - but I like this way of reporting that.

>Take-the-best was originally formulated for inferential tasks in which two alternatives had to be compared to each other on a given criterion. Rieskamp and Hoffrage (1999; 2008) generalized TTB from two-alternative to multi-alternative choice tasks [(p. 648)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=648&annotation=97LYAPMM)

>With eye tracking, there is considerable noise in the information search data due to the fact that sometimes it is impossible to separate voluntary information acquisitions from random fixations that occurred while the participant was thinking. With Mouselab, the process of information acquisition seems to be more systematic, which could be a result of some reactivity of the method on the one hand (see Glöckner & Betsch, 2008), but which leads to data that is easier to interpret on the other hand.

>A more critical finding that we observed in both experiments is that people’s search for information often deviated from what would be expected given the described strategy.1 [(p. 656)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=656&annotation=52GEIVCW)

>It may even be that the link between information search and cognitive processes is less pronounced than commonly assumed.19 [(p. 656)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CDBH97U2?page=656&annotation=55D65IQZ)
