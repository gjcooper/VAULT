## My Thoughts

This states the case fairly clearly on issues relating to the use of experimental paradigms in the study of individual differences. The established experimental paradigm were often developed with a goal of reducing inter-subject variability in order to more clearly show the effect of an experimental manipulation.

This goal directly contrasts typical individual difference tools like questionnaires that attempt to maximise inter-individual differences to allow for stronger correlations with external measures (outcomes/behaviours etc).

There is a definite call for further work on solving this issue, and a request to aim for a more thoughtful approach to selecting experimental paradigms when investigating individual differences.

A lot of this does bear on the goals of the [[Hypatia Health|Hypatia Health beta]] app as the goal of looking at differences over time or between people in treatment groups means we want to be careful to be able to reliably detect those differences.

>This issue is likely to be ubiquitous across all domains where robust experimental tasks have been drawn into correlational studies, under the implicit assumption that a robust experimental effect will serve well as an objective measure of individual variation.

>Hypothetically, an effect could produce reliable betweensubject variation, but also a mean difference large enough so that it can be consistently reproduced across different samples. However, the reliabilities of many the measures reported here, spanning the domains of attention, cognitive control, and processing style, are much lower than most researchers would expect, and fall short of outlined standards (Barch et al., 2008; Cicchetti & Sparrow, 1981; Fleiss, 1981; Landis & Koch, 1977).

>Alternatively, mathematical models of decision making such as the drift-diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998; Ratcliff, Smith, Brown, & McKoon, 2016) decompose RT and accuracy into parameters thought to reflect decision processes.
