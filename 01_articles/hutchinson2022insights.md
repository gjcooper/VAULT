## My Thoughts

What are our limits on consciousness, that is is conscious thought, anything processed by the brain that can be articulated/reported - or are other avenues of thought and stimulus processing that cannot be reported on still consciousness.

This paper tackles some of these questions by introducing some tasks, so called [[failure to report tasks]]. These tasks often involve a primary task (say report the orientation of a rectangle created using gestalt like circle segments). After the initial objective is completed a secondary task is prompted (report the colour of the circle segments). The inability of subjects to correctly report the colour - even though they must have processed the circles is example of a failure to report.
