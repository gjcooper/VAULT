## My Thoughts

An interesting take on belief polarisation, using the [[evidence accumulation models]] to show how people who are fast (low threshold) responders can naturally be pushed towards extremist view by nature of the outsized impact a large positive/negative data point will have on their decision threshold.

I find the approach interesting but ultimately unsatisfying. It is relatively divorced from social impacts and media impacts on the decision making - in fact it quite pointedly attempts to explain extremist view without referencing those factors. However it does not seem to offer much of a solution for the stickiness of those extremist views.

Their proposed solutions also seem to be a bit weak sauce. Change the way people are asked to interact with news media (yeah right).
