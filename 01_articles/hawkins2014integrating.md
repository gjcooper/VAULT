## My Thoughts

A nice, relatively early demonstration of the utility of evidence accumulation models in the context of multiattribute choice. A range of horse race models for best-worst choices are examined, including the [[ranking model]], the [[sequential model]] and the [[enumerated model]]. The choices here seemed to be best-worst scaling of attributes for single options (in the dermatological example) and a full ranking, from which was selected the best and worst choices, on complete option (in the mobile phone example).
 
These early fits were done on aggregated data, based on choice probabilities alone. A new experiment that looked at perceptual judgement (area judgements on rectangles) was then used to show that the addition of response times can discriminate between these horse race models.

There were implications of choice patterns in this study, in that some models can't easily account for best-before-worst, vs worst-before-best choices, especially when choice difficulty influences choice order. Additionally there were poor fits and predictions to response time data from the earlier proposed models.

A [[parallel model]] was proposed that assumes *concurrent* best and worst races, which does surprisingly well, and extensions to more choice scenarios are discussed.
