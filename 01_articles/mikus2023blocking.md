# Blocking D2/D3 dopamine receptors in male participants increases volatility of beliefs when learning to trust others

## My Thoughts

All about belief and trustworthiness of trustees in a repeated Trust game. The models used were the [[Hierarchical Gaussian Filter|HGF]] (two variants) and a [[Rescorla-Wagna]] learning model, very much like the [[Q-learning]] model, just with separate learning rates for gains and losses.

It was very nice to see a comparison of learning rates or belief volatility to genetic variation within the population combined with placebo vs D2 dopamine receptor blocking.

>The belief model uses a hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF) to generate trial-wise sequences of participants’ beliefs about the trustworthiness of two trustees as well as the uncertainty (or precision) surrounding those beliefs [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=4&annotation=584N55VX)

>ω, called belief volatility, that describes how each participant’s precision of beliefs evolved over time and consequently determined the relative rigidity (or malleability) of beliefs [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=4&annotation=SM35P4A8)

>The degree to which inferred trustworthiness correlates with investments is determined by another parameter called the trustworthiness slope (η) [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=4&annotation=LX3JPVYL)

>We compared this model to an HGF model without the γ parameter and a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. The HGF model without γ has been used previously when modelling both social53 and nonsocial54 learning. In this model the non-linear mapping from beliefs to probabilities is modulated by a coupling parameter κ (see Methods for details). [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=5&annotation=P8FMW4EX)

>The RW model is a simple Q-learning model with separate static learning rates for gains (positive outcomes) and for losses (negative outcomes). [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=5&annotation=7LTWD67F)

>Using a hierarchical Gaussian filter to explicitly model the evolution of participants’ beliefs about the trustworthiness of the trustees, we show that sulpiride increased belief volatility. This implies that for the participants under sulpiride, the beliefs about the trustworthiness of others were held with less precision (i.e. with higher uncertainty), which in turn caused increased precision weights on PEs.

>Further, it is also plausible that the processing of uncertainty in a social context is different than in a nonsocial context. People might be inherently more motivated to reduce uncertainty about others, so that they can (for instance) classify them more definitely as being a friend or foe [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D6PGYRGV?page=10&annotation=KD8XNUHZ)
