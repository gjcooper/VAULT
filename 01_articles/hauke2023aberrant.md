## My Thoughts

Also useful resource for the [[HGF Aging Juanita]] project - particularly the [[HGF analysis of MMN]], with quite similar method to the [[weber2020ketamine]] paper. Some useful differences here are that they used age as a regressor, however they don't seem to report much in the way of changes in sequence/fitting due to artifacts in the raw EEG. In fact [[weber2020ketamine]] has a lot more detail in this regard.

>EEG preprocessing consisted of high-pass filtering with a Butterworth filter (0.5 Hz), downsampling (256 Hz), and lowpass filtering using a Butterworth filter (30 Hz), followed by epoching into 500-ms segments around tone onsets (2100 to 400 ms), baseline correction (2100 to 0 ms), and eyeblink correction using principal component analysis with one component (Supplement). Subsequently, remaining artifactual trials were rejected using a 6100-mV amplitude threshold. Preprocessing and statistical analyses were implemented in MATLAB (version 2020b; The MathWorks, Inc.; https:// mathworks.com) using the SPM12 toolbox (version 7771, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/).

>Because we coded deviant tones as 1 and standard tones as 0, positive low-level pwPEs signal that deviant tones are more frequent than expected, whereas negative low-level pwPEs indicate that standard tones are more frequent than expected (although note that the sign depends on how the input is coded).

>We extracted the trajectories of lowlevel pwPEs about the tone tendency e2 and high-level pwPEs about environmental volatility e3. Trial-by-trial magnitude estimates of the absolute value of low-level pwPEs je2j or high-level pwPEs e3 were included as parametric regressors to explain trial-by-trial variation in EEG amplitude (Figure 1B)as done previously (14). The absolute value of e2 was chosen because it expresses Bayesian surprise independent of the physical characteristics of a tone such as a specific frequency.

>When comparing the HC, CHR-P, and ESZ groups, we also included (z-standardized) age as a covariate that was allowed to interact with group (Figure S6) to account for age differences across these groups (Table 1). [(p. 1180)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FG3JZCWW?page=1180&annotation=CHBWB9MP)
