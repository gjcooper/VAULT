# Visual fixations and the computation and comparison of value in simple choice

## My Thoughts

The experimental setup here is similar in some ways to my [[Multidimensional Scaling Phones]] task when there are two stages of the task. In my phones task I ask for a similarity followed by a choice phase, in [[Ian Krajbich]]'s task the first stage is a value judgement on a scale (-10 -> 10), followed by a choice task between items.

The gist is that a relative decision value (slope of the [[diffusion decision model|drift diffusion model]]) captures both the value of each option and the bias towards the currently fixated item. One nice aspect of this model is that it captures qualitative patterns in fixations, such as the length of fixations just before choices being shorter (as this last fixation is often truncated by the choice), L/R bias in fixations predicting L/R choice biases.

I am less convinced by some of the alternative models proposed (say where RDV is more traditional DDM, but fixation lengths increase with higher RDV signal). However this paper does not propose a comprehensive array of alternatives to test.

In fact my whole issue with this work is something of the circular nature of it. If fixations lead to increased drift rates, what process is leading to higher levels of fixation to higher valued options. So other work does show that artificially increasing fixations to one option does increase the probability of it being chosen, so there is merit here, but in the absence of that, what drives initial fixations.

It seems to me that there might be multiple stages here. Initial fixations for exploration, followed by further fixations for gathering either more evidence (as in Krajbich's work), or perhaps by shifting the mean drift rate and reducing the variance in drift. Is this something that could be teased apart in a [[Future Research Ideas]] segment?

**Questions**:
- Was this the genesis of the [[attentional drift diffusion model|aDDM]]?

>When the subject is looking at the left item the RDV changes according to Vt = Vt−1 + d(rleft − θrright) + t, and when he looks at the right item, it changes according to Vt = Vt−1 + d(rright − θrleft) + t, where Vt is the value of the RDV at time t, rleft and rright denote the values of the two options, d is a constant that controls the speed of integration (in units of ms−1), θ between 0 and 1 is a parameter that reflects the bias toward the fixated option, and t is white Gaussian noise with variance σ2 [(p. 1292)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AZ8WBXBM?page=1292&annotation=YRWXXQRX)

> From Guy's email to Jess:

The model is of less interest for your project. The relevant aspect is what they did in their experimental study. There were two phases, similar to what your study will involve. In the first phase participants rated a set of options presented individually based on how much they liked them. The second phase presented two options that had been rated in the first phase and asked participants to select the option they liked better. Among other things, Krajbich et al. examined choices and mean response times (RT) for the choices in phase 2 as a function of the difference in the liking ratings given in phase 1 (Figure 2a, b). The two phases of their experiment are quite similar to yours, though there are some important differences . For example, Krajbich et al. used implicitly defined products (a picture) whereas we will use the standard approach for a DCE - objectively defined products (i.e., listing attribute features). Other papers by Krajbich and Rangel are also relevant to the setup of your study. This analysis approach is like the 'simpler' analysis I describe in the study overview.
