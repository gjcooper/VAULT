## My Thoughts

A nice, detailed reanalysis of a large range of published data, that generally provided support for the power law of practice, but based primarily on aggregated data. My work on the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper will draw on this as one of the examples for why aggregated data can obscure the true individual data generating process. On reanalysis the an exponential function, or the super-model APEX (which has the power function and exponential function as special cases) provided a better fit to approximately more than 80% of the data.

One particular example where some participants were better modelled by a exponential and some by a power function was particularly relevant here.

>The finding reinforces our earlier caution that practice functions from different subjects should not be averaged, not only because variation of learning rates can distort the shape ofthe average function, but also because an individual subject's learning may occasionally follow afunction other than the usual exponential form.

>Averaging and practice functions. Averaging usually distorts the form of the practice function. Our analyses for individual subjects and conditions stand in marked contrast to Newell and Rosenbloom's (1981) results for averages over subjects and conditions. Empirically, we found that averaging over within-subjects conditions can produce abias in favor of the power function. We also found that practice curves for asmall minority ofsubjects may differ from the usual exponential form. Consequently, as Newell (1973) remarked, averaging "conceals, rather than reveals. You get garbage or, even worse, spurious regularity" (p. 295). [(p. 199)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JBBAUZC?page=199&annotation=8YJ9EGFX)

>Rickard (1997) recently suggested that the power law of practice fails because subjects use amixture of algorithmic and memory-based processes, especially early in practice. Although he maintained that both algorithmic and memory-based processes individually follow apower function, he argued that the mixture does not follow apower function.

>If so, the shape of the practice function may have been distorted by averaging over conditions with different learning rates. [(p. 197)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6JBBAUZC?page=197&annotation=LB4MENEA)

>However, our results indicate that the ability of nonlinear functions to imitate each other does not make the form ofthe practice function an insoluble technical issue. Furthermore, our results indicate that the form ofthe practice function can provide auseful constraint for theories of skill acquisition.
