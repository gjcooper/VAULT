# Strategies for multiattribute binary choice

Russo, J. E., & Dosher, B. A. (1983). Strategies for multiattribute binary choice. _Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition_, _9_(4), 676â€“696. [https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.9.4.676](https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.9.4.676)

## My Thoughts

Wow - a lot here. Big takeaway is outlining the link between effort and the selection of [[decision strategies]]. Some of the topics covered here were contrasting decision simplifications like using [[Majority of Confirming Dimensions Heuristic|MCD]] to simplify from full utility calculations, or using something like [[dimension reduction]], that is dropping the least informative dimension (attribute) before calculating utilities.

Of specific note to me is that people tended towards MCD even when a full utility calculation would make more sense such as in risky gambles. A lot of the paper talks about _holistic processing_ as in the [[Weighted Additive Rule|Addition of utilities rule]] as compared to _dimensional processing_ (like in the [[Additive Difference Strategy|Additive difference model]]). Russo et al consistently found that dimensional processing wins out (that is within attributes/across options) based on their [[Eye tracking for process tracing|eye tracking]] fixation results as well as partially confirmed by their [[prompted verbal protocol]].

Overall the numbers were low, and other decision strategies were not assessed, or even considered - but this could partially be due to the age and technical limitations.

>The six stimulus components typically received their first fixation in a stereotyped pattern, usually based on the standard reading order of left to right and top to bottom, with some deviations and repetition. Averaged over the four subjects, 9.6 fixations were required before all six numbers had been fixated once. These initial fixations seemed to provide an overview of the alternatives before the subjects invoked their comparison strategy. Lussier and Olshavsky (1979) reported a similar initial "straightforward reading of the information" (p. 162) in a consumer choice task. Because this reading period seemed distinct from the comparison strategy and did not discriminate between holistic and dimensional strategies, we confined our analysis to the postreading fixations only.

>Over all subjects, there were 1,026 instances of dimensional processing, about 14 per trial. In contrast, only 34 instances of holistic processingwerereported, about one every two trials. Further, 21 of these 34 holistic reports were by Subject 2. [(p. 683)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LNI96NJP?page=683&annotation=MCK8MZHV)

>Conery presented two subjects with 60 gambles like the ones used in Experiment 3. The instructions were to use a pure EVstrategy on 30 consecutive choices and a pure dimensional strategy on the remaining 30. The pure EV strategy was accurate multiplication, in the head, of probabilities and payoffs. The pure dimensional strategy required computing the two dimensional differences and choosing the gamble indicated by the larger difference (ignoring units). For the dimensional strategy, the accuracies of the two subjectswere .67 and .63. The corresponding efforts, as measured by decision time, were 16 and 13 sec. For the holistic (EV) strategy, the accuracies were .92 and .91, with times of 110 and 118 sec, respectively. [(p. 692)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LNI96NJP?page=692&annotation=TMJQ3WAU)
