## My Thoughts

([O'Connell et al., 2012](zotero://select/library/items/B882QHEY)) presents an impressive body of work, showing quite convincingly an ERP signal that corresponds to evidence accumulation in the lead up to a decision. Multiple experiments that test the proposed ERP signal in different modalities, with and without recorded trial by trial decisions, interrupted target signals and more. One thing of note is that there does not appear to be separate distinct processes, sensory input -> decision process -> motor initiation/control, but rather all seem to be in operation over the course of a decision.

I personally would like to see what this signal looks like in a task where a choice 2AFC is made rather than what appears to be a simple target detection task.
