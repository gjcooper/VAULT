# Random utility models with equality: An apparent, but not actual, generalization of random utility models

## My Thoughts

This is something I should come back to and read in more detail later, however the hint of an extension to the model discussed more fully in order to deal with situations in which a "No Choice" option is presented is interesting for the paper I am writing on [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]]. Specifically with the [[Weighted Additive Rule]] and similar [[compensatory]] decision strategies, if the [[utility]] of an option does not meet some internal required level, the option under consideration could be rejected from a set.
