## My Thoughts

This is a brief review of a select group of five papers that cover a general idea that [[psychological distance in consumer choice]] affects decision making and the perceived difficulty of said choices. This has admittedly tenuous links to my [[psychological space]] work as my concept of distance in those spaces is the distance within the space between options, where as the distance referred to here is some distance between the decision maker (consumer) and the outcome of their choice (consumption). This distance can also be a temporal distance, a spacial distance or other types.

Some of the linked papers may be partially useful.

>The article by Bornemann and Homburg shows that because psychological distance increases the salience of desirability relative to feasibility concerns, consumers perceive high prices more favorably when the purchase is temporally distant or when they are evaluating a product for someone else than they do when the purchase is temporally close or when evaluating the product for themselves.
