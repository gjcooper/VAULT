## My Thoughts

Again related to [[attentional capture]], this time relating to differences in attentional capture, and specifically in this case omissions caused by that capture, under different levels of [[working memory]] load.

Counter to intuition perhaps, when working memory load was higher their were higher numbers of omissions.
