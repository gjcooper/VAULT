# A new integrated model of noncompensatory and compensatory decision strategies

## My Thoughts

([Elrod et al., 2004](zotero://select/library/items/R8XLJZKN)) provides a nice summary of the issues with self-report and some forms of collection of protocol data, as well as a superficial overview of utility theory development. Elrod et al then propose a new model that integrates compensatory (the linear additive model) and non-compensatory decision strategies (conjunctive and disjunctive rules). They postulate a value function based on a general non-rectangular hyperbola ([Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E8FAJLNU?page=19&annotation=undefined) “Ross, G. J. S. (1990). Nonlinear estimation. New York: Springer Verlag.” ([Elrod et al., 2004, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/R8XLJZKN))) that includes both the compensatory and non-compensatory functions, as well as additions of the two (although no information can be acquired about the order of their processing). In fact true compensatory and non-compensatory decision strategies are special cases of the general function outlined here. In addition the cut-off’s used for non-compensatory strategies can be pervasive, that is when the attribute level is close to the boundary the boundary has an effect. In other words, for an attribute that is just above a cut-off, it will be assessed negatively when compared with an attribute whose level is well above the cut-off.

>Self-reports are suspect because subjects may be unaware of their own decision strategies or unable to report them accurately (e.g., Nisbett & Wilson, 1977) [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E8FAJLNU?page=1&annotation=FJXS7J2F)

>Methods for collecting protocol data, such as information display boards, can interfere with the decision process they measure in several ways (e.g., Billings & Marcus, 1983; Ford, Schmitt, Schechtman, Hults, & Doherty, 1989). For example, they may (a) induce subjects to process information more carefully when their decision process is being monitored, (b) direct subjects’ attention to attributes that would be ignored in a naturalistic setting (Brucks, 1985), and/or (c) cause information overload.
