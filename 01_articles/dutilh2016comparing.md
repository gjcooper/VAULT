# Comparing perceptual and preferential decision making

## My Thoughts

([Dutilh and Rieskamp, 2016](zotero://select/library/items/YLDCVQ4X)) outline the [[diffusion decision model|diffusion model]] and its use in perceptual decision making research to account for RT variability and errors, as well as applications of similar evidence accumulation models in risky choice.

Two key differences in the application of sequential sampling models to the two domains (preferential and perceptual) are outlined. For perceptual tasks a correct response can be determined, however in preferential tasks the quality of the response is subjective and it is only with respect to the subjective goal that a response can be assessed. Secondly, especially with regards to risky choices the outcome of a decision is not determined by the choice made alone, but also by some amount of chance.

The primary paradigm is a task that can be approached with either a perceptual or risky gamble (preferential) instruction. Modelling demonstrated a reduction in caution (boundary separation) for perceptual contexts of the task, which could reflect different payoff levels of the perceptual vs preferential versions of the task, or an attempt to keep a similar pace across both task versions (as information processing was lower in the preferential task version).

All in all this is an interesting approach, but something more I think needs to be done about integrating the model to account for both task types in a more holistic way.
