## My Thoughts

Again perhaps of some use for my [[UNSW Job Talk]] as it discusses effects of reward driven and memory driven processes on attention via [[attentional capture]].

The idea of looking at longer duration effects using something like risky choice is somewhat intriguing to me.

I was also struck by the choice to look in the second task at trial sequences where the colour of the last trial occurs as a distractor in the current trial.

>To summarize, when both reward-related colors appeared in the choice array, participants more often chose the number in the high-reward color than the low-reward color â€“ even though color was irrelevant to this task, in that numbers were assigned randomly to locations. This finding indicates that automatic biases in reward-related attention can shape subsequent processes of information gathering and hence influence overt behavioral choice.

>Hence we considered the subset of trials in which the color of the current target was different from the color of the target on the previous trial, and compared choice performance on trials where the choice array contained (1) the current memory target vs the previous memory target, versus (2) the current memory target vs the third color (that was not the target on the current or previous trial; we term this the alternate).
