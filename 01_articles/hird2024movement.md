## My Thoughts

A good [[review article]] that looks at the links between the benefits of exercise and depression symptoms such as [[anhedonia]] and [[apathy]]. This could relate to [[Hypatia Health]] as a source for possible tasks, particularly those that use some sort of effortful response in order to more closely link reward learning to the value that participants place on that reward.

There are links drawn here between the aforementioned exercise/effort and [[motivation]], [[reward processing]] and [[cognitive control]]

>We initially summarise possible mechanisms underlying the motivational symptoms of depression including dopamine-driven changes in effort-based decision making and associated brain circuitry - and their relationship with inflammation [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=ALZT99EG)

>Apathy refers to a loss of enthusiasm for a variety of activities, which is often expressed as lower motivation to perform goal-directed behaviour across different domains of function [36]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=GKMU34UW)

>Anhedonia is defined as diminished interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and is a core part of the interestactivity cluster of depressive symptoms [37]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=ZVXH7H3A)

>[!quote|#5fb236]
>It has been hypothesised that both apathy and anhedonia are driven by an impairment in reward processing [38–42]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=8CUGEJCS)

>However, one difficulty in interpreting his literature is that many tasks used to measure reward learning do not dissociate reward learning from reward value (the internal expectation assigned to potentially rewarding outcomes [47]).

>Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) [69]. In this task, physical effort is manipulated by the number of button presses required in a fixed amount of time and the potential reward that can be obtained is varied [69]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=Z4NY4TA5)

>In such designs participants decide on each trial whether to accept an effortful challenge to win varying amounts of reward, as in the Apple Gathering Task (AGT) [72]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EJP7F56L?page=2&annotation=I9W6N6K3)

>Cognitive control (often called executive function) describes a set of effortful cognitive processes [75] which allow for flexible adaptation of behaviour in line with goals [76], including functions such as working memory, task-switching, response inhibition and attentional control [77].
