## My Thoughts

This work covers a nice selection of decision making models, both heuristics and some more complete algorithms that are more in the realm of fully rational models of decision making. One aspects of this paper is that the decisions looked at here are decisions from memory, or _inference from memory_ as opposed to the work I do which is more along the lines of the stated _inference from givens_.

This article does not provide empirical evidence, but more the results of simulations of the [[Take the Best]] decision making model, and it's variants, [[Take the Last]] and the [[Minimalist]] model, and compare it to accuracy and time taken for more rational models of decision making, such as [[Tallying]], [[Tallying|Weighted Tallying]], [[Tallying|Unit-weight Linear Model]], [[Tallying|Weighted Linear Model]] and [[Multiple Regression]].

Overall the decision accuracy of the heuristics performs as well of, and sometimes better than the rational models, under the constraint of less than perfect knowledge. The heuristics all make faster decisions too.

>The unit-weight linear model is a special case of the equalweight linear model (Huber, 1989) and has been advocated as a good approximation of weighted linear models (Dawes, 1979; Einhorn & Hogarth, 1975). [(p. 657)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6TNCCKP?page=657&annotation=RDEVJQUD)

>Limited Search Both one-reason decision making and the recognition principle realize limited search by defining stopping points. Integration algorithms, in contrast, do not provide any model of stopping points and implicitly assume exhaustive search (although they may provide rules for tossing out some of the variables in a lengthy regression equation). Stopping rules are crucial for modeling inference under limited time, as in Simon's examples of satisficing, where search among alternatives terminates when a certain aspiration level is met.
