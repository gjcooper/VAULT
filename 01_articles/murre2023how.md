## My Thoughts

A nice mathematical illustration of the problems when averaging over individuals drawn from one of any number of distributions can lead to an average curve that matches a different distribution. This work draws from [[estes2005risks|Risks of drawing inferences about cognitive processes from model fits to individual versus average performance]] and [[heathcote2000power|The power law repealed: The case for an exponential law of practice]] and is a more up to date reference that can be used to inform the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] paper.

>The raw data would allow one to examine and fit the individual curves, which in all cases is to be preferred. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/253BNXCH?page=2&annotation=9ASGV5HG)

>I also concur with Sidmanâ€™s warning (Iversen, 2021; Sidman, 1952) that attaching theoretical implications to the shape of an averaged curve may lead to unwarranted conclusions, where averaging artefacts over subjects and items form at the very least an important source of distortion, as is demonstrated in this paper.
