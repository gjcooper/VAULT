## Item Notes

### High Level Overview

This chapter provides an introduction to the concept of consumer choice as a multiattribute, multi-alternative choice between competing alternatives 2+ differing on 1 on more *attributes*. A [[list of decision strategies]] proposed for choosing between these options, with references to original papers where the strategies were proposed is presented.

Characteristics of these decisions and each presented decision strategy are discussed, as well as a review of the methods used to determine which decision strategy has been used in a individuals choices.

The chapter finished by discussing the influence of complexity of the choice task and the influence of attribute or context complexity on the decision strategy used by people.

### Detailed Notes

Section 2.2 is of most relevance to my first paper, with the characteristics of decisions ([[compensatory]]  vs [[non-compensatory]] decision strategies, aspirations levels being discussed at a high level, followed by the list of each decision strategy with a brief discussion. The Appendix A from the same book gives some great tables comparing each decision strategy on aspects such as compensatory processing and more.

### Relevance to my Work

Of high relevance, this work was a large basis for my first paper  ([[SFT of DCE]]), with a fair amount of the language from that paper being drawn from this chapter.
