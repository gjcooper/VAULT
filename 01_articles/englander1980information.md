# Information seeking in open decision situations

Engländer, T., & Tyszka, T. (1980). Information seeking in open decision situations. _Acta Psychologica_, _45_(1–3), 169–176.

# My Thoughts

Engländer introduces the method of [[Active Information Search]] where participants are introduced to a decision domain and are instructed to request information about the options in order to inform their final decision. It is a very open ended [[process tracing]] technique, that allows for great flexibility, however there are some significant limitations.

The method does not match well with current consumer information displays on line where all features are apparent at once. This means that although decision strategies can be inferred from the order of which information is requested and when, there is less direct applicability to more ecologically valid contexts.
