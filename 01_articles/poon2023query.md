# A query theory account of the attraction effect

## My Thoughts

A mildy interesting, if not really fruitful paper. this work illustrates that a [[Query Theory]] approach can account for the [[attraction effect]] in multi-attribute choice.
One big question I have in relation to this work is whether query theory, or rather the implementation of it here where people are prompted to come up with reasons to choose one option (or another) in a stage of the task called here [[aspect listing]], could really be said to be capturing how people make choices in more natural settings.

I can certainly see that some people may make some choices by querying each option with questions such as "Will this phone have enough storage capacity". And query theory seems appropriate if people are making choices that way. However the set up for these studies "force" participants to make choices with this approach front and centre. That is, if we strongly encourage people to make choices with this framing, then the attraction effect still exists and can be explained by the aspects that people list.

Without this framing though - do we make choices in the same way? what happens if all options available meet our [[aspiration level]]s? After all our queries, we still need to decide between the competing options.
