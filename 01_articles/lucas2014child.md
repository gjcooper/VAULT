## My Thoughts

An interesting application of [[Multinomial Logit Models]] as a first pass model for how young children both make their own decisions (exhibiting their preferences) as well as infer how others they see and interact with make their choices. The preferences for others are then assumed to be updated in a Bayesian fashion.

The model application here is treated with a light tough - which I guess is OK for such a well known model, but leaves me wanting a little more. Indeed, it is less that the model seems to be fit to data and more that the models are applied using assumptions of model parameters an then the qualitative fits are done, although MSE is reported so presumably there is more detail in the supplementary material.

>One of the most common assumptions is that hidden utilities follow a Gumbel distribution (or, in practice, a normal distribution [9]), which leads to a choice rule in which people are exponentially more likely to choose an option as its observable features become more attractive [10].

>This simple choice rule is also commonplace in the psychological literature, where it has been called the [[Luce choice axiom|Luce-Shepard choice rule]] [11,12]. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VA3K7PWS?page=2&annotation=QZDZ7XUJ)

>We tested an alternative approach based on Tversky’s ‘‘[[Elimination by Aspect Strategy|Elimination by Aspects]]’’ (EBA) choice model [19], and found that a straightforward version could not account for many of the basic phenomena we observed.
