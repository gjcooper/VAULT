## My Thoughts

I can definitely see the influence of [[Ben Newell]] here given the focus on [[noninstrumental information]] on this [[reward learning]] paradigm. It has little direct value for my work. There seems to be analyses here that cry out for individual effects analysis and most likely hierarchical modelling as well.

>We explicitly informed participants about this stochastic design feature to reduce a potentially confounding source of response variability: participants’ belief that there is a pattern to the choice–outcome payoffs, which has been found to arise in decisions-from-experience tasks (see Szollosi et al., 2023).

>The current work also provides evidence that the rewards people receive on a trial influence their subsequent choices (see the win-stay, lose-shift model analysis), as observed in similar bandit tasks (e.g., Worthy et al., 2013). People’s winstay, lose-shift behaviours did not differ however between information conditions; this suggests that while people showed increased preferences for informative options, their sensitivity to the previously experienced outcome was unaltered by the presence of noninstrumental information.
