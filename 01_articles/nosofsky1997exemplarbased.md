## My Thoughts

This work is an extension of the [[Generalised Context Model]], however it also includes features of another model of [[G. D. Logan]]'s [[instance-based model of automaticity]].

Possibly of use in the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]] in future if I want to do prediction of response times with it. Aside from this there was a bit of discussion of a descriptive model called the [[RT-distance hypothesis]] - where greater distance from a decision bound leads to faster decisions. One limitation is the fits were done to mean response times, and that there was not a full process model of the whole decision, rather the motor and perception components were fixed across all trials and a linear model was used to scale the model parameters to fit actual data.
