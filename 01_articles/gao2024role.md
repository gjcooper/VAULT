## My Thoughts

This paper on [[Categorisation]] focusses mainly on [[rule-based categorisation]] where participants mostly learn a rule that deterministically leads to a correct categorisation of the target. However in Experiment 3 they do remove the rule learning an stress mostly probabilistic features that lead to a correct categorisation. This leads to behaviour more in line with [[Similarity]] based models such as the [[nosofsky2011generalized|The generalized context model: an exemplar model of classification]].

A major goal of this research is to look into the role of attention on the learning of the category rules, and the subsequent behaviour. In particular the role of attention of how participants engaged [[focussing]] on relevant features for successful category assignment vs how they used [[filtering]] to ignore irrelevant features (the probabilistic features touched o0n in learning).
