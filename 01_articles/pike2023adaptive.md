## My Thoughts

Higher learning rates in recovered [[eating disorder]] (specifically [[Anorexia Nervosa]]) were discovered via the use of [[reinforcement learning]] model(s) applied to some clinical data. However at risk people (who showed symptons but no diagnosis) were not significantly different to controls.

Of interest here is that the behavioural measures in the RL task like switch/stay analysis did not show any significant differences between the group(s).

>The results presented in Fig. 3 suggest that perhaps this is the best explanation this group have numerically greater learning rate adjustment values than the HC group, though less than the RA group. Future research should consider this, and use a more conservative estimate of effect sizes for power calculations for risk groups compared to clinically-diagnosed groups.
