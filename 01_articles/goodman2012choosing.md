## My Thoughts

Although there is a lot of mention of [[psychological distance in consumer choice]] here again like the [[hutchinson2022insights]] paper the concept of psychological distance here is separate to my work on the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]] as it is informed by the concept of [[construal level theory]].

The idea here is that the more psychologically distant you are from a choice, the more high-level (abstract) you treat those decisions. More abstraction should therefore lead you to not focus on the problems with choosing between a lot of options and lead to a choice of a large assortment (more possible options to choose between).

>Researchers have conceptualized assortment choice in a hierarchical fashion where a consumer chooses a product assortment in the first phase (e.g., what store to visit) and then chooses a specific product in the second phase (Broniarczyk 2008; Chernev 2006; Kahn and Lehman 1991; Kahn, Moore, and Glazer 1987; Sood, Rottenstreich, and Brenner 2004).

>When events take place here and in the present and are happening to us with certainty, we are more likely to construe them in terms of specific, subordinate, incidental, and contextual features that convey details of the information (a low level or concrete construal).

>On the other hand, when events take place in a distant location, later in time, to others, and/or with ambiguity, consumers construe them in terms of simple, general, superordinate, and decontextualized features that convey the essence of the information (a high level or abstract construal).

>In experiments 1A and 1B, we find that when participants were given the choice between a large and small assortment (with no explicit reference to feasibility/desirability tradeoff), those who were psychologically proximal preferred a larger assortment, but when the consumption was farther out in the future (experiment 1A) or in a more distal location (experiment 1B), this overwhelming preference for the larger assortment retailer decreased significantly.

>Experiment 2 further supports our theory that psychological distance from the decision leads to higher level representations, making options appear more substitutable, and leading participants to be more indifferent between retailers offering large and a small assortments.

>This experiment identifies the saliency of trade-off information as a key moderator to the desire for large assortments and provides further support for our framework. While experiments 1–3 show support for the abstraction hypothesis, experiment 4 shows support for the feasibility/ desirability hypothesis when feasibility/desirability trade-off information is salient. In the absence of explicit trade-off information, the preference for large assortments diminishes when consumers are psychologically distant from the decision. When explicit trade-off information is made salient, however, we find the opposite results: the preference for large assortments diminishes for psychologically proximal consumers.
