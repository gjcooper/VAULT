## My Thoughts

Not sure of the relevance here, but it seems that some measures are better than others at predicting the difficulty that humans with have at solving TSP instances.

I was not 100% convinced as it seems experimentally the participants were not asked to solve TSP directly, but were given another task that could be thought of as equivalent (efficiently solving that task requires a TSP solution).

It seems to me though that there were other aspects of the task (time implementing the task) that would influence the effort expended in solving the best possible path.
