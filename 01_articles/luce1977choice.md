## My Thoughts

An OK overview of the choice axiom, with its application in various domains of decision making discussed, as well as some extensions of the rule.

After reading about  [[Luce choice axiom|Luce Choice axiom]] in here I am only slightly more in the know, and am starting to get a feel for it. The generalised version with a L/R bias seems to be something I might need for the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]].
