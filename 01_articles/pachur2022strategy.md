# Strategy selection in decisions from givens: Deciding at a glance?

## My Thoughts

I like this paper, although I have some questions and reservations. I still don't think I fully understand the [[Bayesian Multilevel Model]] approach borrowed and adjusted from [[Michael Lee]]. It was also not apparent whether the attribute positions were stable within participants, or whether they changed on each new trial.

There is a nice review of papers that look at the proportions of people who employ either a [[compensatory]] or [[non-compensatory]] decision strategy in so-called decisions from givens.

It was an interesting choice to use symbols not usually reflected in natural decision making contexts, meaning that participants had to be taught (and then remember) the association between the symbol and a positive/negative value for that attribute. Indications are OK though that people did use this successfully.

The two experiments varied the number of attributes (4 vs 8) and attribute coding (varied vs uniform) and participants were assigned to one of the four possible conditions. In both experiments participants in the 4 attribute case were more likely to be classified as using the compensatory strategies ([[Weighted Additive Rule|WADD]] or [[Equal Weight Heuristic|EQW]]) as compared to either random guessing of the non-compensatory strategy [[Take the Best|TTB]].

Additionally, in the appendices there is a great resource for my [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]], a formula for the [[Luce choice axiom|Luce Choice axiom]] with sensitivity.

>no study has yet systematically examined the use of noncompensatory and compensatory strategies while varying both factors within the same experimental paradigm, holding everything else (e.g., distribution of attribute importance, type of stimuli) constant.

>To deriveH for WADD and TTB, I used the importanceweights provided to participants on the screenat each trial to weight the attributes and order them, respectively. The strategy used to account for the data is determinedby the categorical strategy node z; it can take on values1, 2, 3, and 4, representingWADD, EQW, TTB, and guessing, respectively.

>This suggests that compensatory strategies may entail qualitatively different processes of information integration depending on the number of attributes. Specifically, the amount of evidence for an alternative —in terms of the (weighted) number of positive or negative attributes—could be determined by subitizing with four attributes, but more effortful, controlled processes were required with eight attributes, as reflected in considerably longer response times.
