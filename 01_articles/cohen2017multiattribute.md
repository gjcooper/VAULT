## My Thoughts

A massive investigation of various [[Random Utility Model]]'s, heuristics such as [[Elimination by Aspect Strategy|EBA]], [[Lexicographic Heuristic|LEX]] and the [[Maximum Attribute Value]] heuristic, and process models such as the Multiattribute [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]] and the [[Multiattribute Decision Field Theory|MDFT]] and how they compare when modelling multioption (3 options) multiattribute choices in both a [[Preferential Choice]] and a [[Risky Choice]] context.

The take home is the the [[MLBA]] outperforms the other models in most cases, although their is significant misfit for individual trial response times.

>The first aim of this research was to compare utility, heuristic, and dynamic models in a multi-alternative, multi-attribute experimental paradigm where all attribute values were explicit and presented separately. [(p. 62)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DQCR5NZC?page=62&annotation=L9E845IG)

>Consistent with previous results using the LBA (Brown & Heathcote, 2008), the MLBA does an excellent job accounting for overall response time distributions in both tasks. However, the MLBA can only weakly predict RTs for individual stimuli (but see Trueblood & Dasari, 2017). None of the other models could predict RT at the stimulus-level.
