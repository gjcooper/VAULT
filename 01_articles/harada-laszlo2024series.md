## My Thoughts

Whilst the modelling here for a four-armed bandit [[reinforcement learning]] task with associated [[Rescorla-Wagna]] and related models like Vmax do not bear our the hypothesised relationship between reinforcement learning parameters and the self-reported [[catastrophising]] measures it is a nice clean write-up of some behavioural relationships and model parameter associations.

It also introduces two novel model variations that attempt to capture an effect of the history of negative outcomes (0 reward - but framed as negative). One model scaled the history of negative outcomes on learning rate and the other scaled the history on inverse temperature.

>We then initially tested the fit of six learning models to our data,  including the Standard Rescorla–Wagener Model (Rescorla, 1972),  the Rescorla–Wagner model with a sensitivity term (Huys et al., 2013),  the Vmax model (Huang et al., 2017) and the Pearce–Hall  associability model (Pearce & Hall, 1980), [(p. 77)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QCBFHQQ2?page=77&annotation=HFXNX45B)
