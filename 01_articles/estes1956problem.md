>Functions unmodified by averaging. In these cases the mean curve for the group has the form of the individual function and the parameters of the mean curve are simply the means of the corresponding individual parameters.

# Summary

([Estes, 1956](zotero://select/library/items/J99JKTLI)) outlines the problems associated with using mean curves of learning when investigating the individual learning rates of participants. The primary objection is not that a mean curve does not necessarily reflect any individuals response pattern, instead the misuse of group level mean curves to drive inference about individual performance on the tasks.

Instead ([Estes, 1956](zotero://select/library/items/J99JKTLI)) proposes reframing the inference from using the data to try and answer the question of what form does the function of individual performance take, to instead ask whether the mean empirical curve supports an assumption of a particular hypothesised individual functional form _f._
