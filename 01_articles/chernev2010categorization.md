## My Thoughts

I think this simple idea goes a long way, the implicit "categorisation" of food stimuli into healthy/unhealthy foods (or as Chernev & Gal put it virtues and vices) appears to cause an averaging of estimated caloric content of the meals when estimating the caloric content of a virtue + vice combination as compared to a vice + vice or separate judgement of the individual items.

This combination of the two ends of of a continuous scale of _healthiness_ has some implications for the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|GCM inspired analysis]] I have been doing.

>From a conceptual standpoint, we attribute the averaging bias to the qualitative nature of the information associated with the vice/virtue categorization of the available options (Rozin, Ashmore, and Markwith 1996). Specifically, we argue that when evaluating combinations of healthy and indulgent food items, people tend to focus on their qualitative aspects as reflected by the vice/virtue categorization rather than on their quantitative nature (e.g., calorie content).

>This finding is consistent with the prediction that the averaging bias is likely to occur only for virtue/vice combinations and should not occur in combinations of two vices. [(p. 740)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FQSVCJDX?page=740&annotation=9BMNGH7J)

> In contrast, size-based evaluations are more likely to promote the use of an additive rather than an averaging rule in evaluating the calorie content of the available options and thus are likely to attenuate the calorie under estimation effect.
