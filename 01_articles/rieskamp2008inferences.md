# Inferences under time pressure: How opportunity costs affect strategy selection

Rieskamp, J., & Hoffrage, U. (2008). Inferences under time pressure: How opportunity costs affect strategy selection. _Acta Psychologica_, _127_(2), 258–276. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.05.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.05.004)

## My Thoughts

Looked at a range on possible [[compensatory]] and [[non-compensatory]] strategies using both [[process tracing]] ([[information boards]]) and [[outcome-based]] measures. This combination of the two approaches is often called for but rarely implemented. Results showed a strong preferences for [[Lexicographic Heuristic|LEX]], especially as time pressures increase (compared to the other main strategy, [[Weighted Additive Rule|WADD]])

I have issues with the process tracing method in use here, and the outcome based measure used is not clear to me.

>It has been criticized that the empirical support for the inference heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer et al. is rather weak (e.g., Bro ̈ der, 2000; Chater, 2000; Lipshitz, 2000; Newell, 2005). Yet recent studies have provided evidence that simple heuristics can be good descriptions of people’s inferences (Bro ̈ der, 2000, 2003; Bro ̈ der & Schiffer, 2003; [(p. 258)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AP69ULRK?page=258&annotation=HC28784G)

>To infer the strategies people select we combined a process-oriented and an outcome-oriented method, which has rarely been done in previous research (for exceptions, see Payne, Bettman, & Luce, 1996; Senter & Wedell, 1999). The process-oriented method analyzes the information search (e.g., Beach & Mitchell, 1978; Payne et al., 1993; Russo & Dosher, 1983; Svenson, 1979, 1992) and relates particular types of information search to specific strategies.

>The outcome-oriented approach often faces the problem that different strategies come to identical predictions, making it impossible to determine (based on the outcome) which strategy was applied. To solve this problem, it is necessary to construct decision problems (items) where strategies’ predictions deviate from each other.

>participants with a low average decision time were most frequently classified as ‘‘selecting’’ noncompensatory heuristics, especially LEX. In contrast, participants with high average decision times were more likely best described with compensatory strategies, especially WADD. Thus, the process-oriented and the outcome-oriented analysis provide converging evidence. [(p. 272)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AP69ULRK?page=272&annotation=7UARZR6S)
