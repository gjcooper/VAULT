## My Thoughts

An overview of the types of decision strategies (more broadly than my work on [[Modelling of Veridical and Preferential Choice]]). Here the strategies ecompassed by Beach and Mitchell's "model" include the unaided analytic strategies I have previously considered ([[compensatory]] and [[non-compensatory]] strategies for example). However, they also include [[aided decision strategies]] (which call for the use of tools like decision aides to assist in the decision making process), and non-analytic decision strategies like habits and random selection.

Additionally to discussing this vast range of possible strategy types they also discuss the factors that influence the election of a specific strategy, breaking them into two categories, the characteristics of the decision task (complexity,/unfamiliarity etc of the decision problem, and significance/constraints of the decision environment) and the characteristics of the decision maker (knowledge, ability and motivation).

The "model" they propose is just a sum of the weighted aspects of each of the component of the decision problem and environment, and then relationships with this weighted sum to the utilities that the decision maker places on making a correct decision and use of their resources (time/money etc).

While this is (as they say) a complex model, which they really offer no insight on how to test any aspects of, what I think they are really going for here is what they leave this paper on, that this is a call to action to consider the factors that come into play for peoples choices of which strategy to employ.

>A decision strategy consists of: (a) the set of procedures that the decision maker engages in when attempting to select among alternative courses of action, and (b) a decision rule that dictates how the results of the engaged-in procedures will be used to make the actual decision [(p. 439)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F8LTLTJJ?page=439&annotation=HHXKAF5F)
