## My Thoughts

This is a very similar goal to our approach, classifying into decision strategies using components of the strategy assumptions, however the methods rely on the same process-tracing apparatuses that could be problematic in assessing true decision strategies.

The table at [p 796](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/72E3CIV6?page=796) is a great summary of different aspects of strategies. Need to review this.

>Understanding decision makers’ cognitive processes not only allows us to infer the decision strategy used, but also makes it possible to predict future decisional behavior and decision outcomes (Payne, Braunstein, & Carroll, 1978). Furthermore, knowing people’s decision strategies facilitates the design of decision support systems (Browne, Pitts, & Wetherbe, 2007; A. L. Montgomery, Hosanagar, Krishnan, & Clay, 2004; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993). [(p. 795)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/72E3CIV6?page=795&annotation=T58G3PFL)

>The variety of process-tracing techniques is large. During the past decades, the following techniques have been developed and continuously enhanced: (1) tracing of eye movements (Just & Carpenter, 1976; Lohse & Johnson, 1996; Russo, 1978a, 1978b; Russo & Rosen, 1975); (2) information display boards (Arch, Bettman, & Kakkar, 1978; Payne, 1976; Wilkins, 1964); (3) computerized process tracing, such as Mouselab (Payne et al., 1993), ISLab (G. J. Cook & Swain, 1993), ISCube (Tabatabai, 1998), or MouseTrace (Jasper & Shapiro, 2002); (4) phased narrowing (Jasper & Levin, 2001; Levin & Jasper, 1995); (5) active information search (Huber, Wider, [(p. 795)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/72E3CIV6?page=795&annotation=WKEFR23T)

>Consider, for instance, the design of Internet shops. If marketers and software engineers know their potential customers’ preferred decision strategies, they can tailor online shops that actively support customers’ decision-making processes (for recent research, see Cothey, 2002; Jaillet, 2002; Johnson, Moe, Fader, Bellman, & Lohse, 2004; Lohse & Spiller, 1998; A.
