## Summary

([Fisher, 2017](zotero://select/library/items/Q69BEVRF)) follows on from a history of applying sequential sampling models of decision making in multi-attribute choices by extending the [[attentional drift diffusion model|aDDM]] ([Krajbich et al., 2010](zotero://select/library/items/6M5KRPS8); Krajbich and Rangel, 2011; Krajbich et al., 2012) to cover binary-attribute choices, where individuals accept or reject a single option with two attributes. One limitation of Fisher’s approach was the inability to fit the model to data at an individual level, so individual differences in the effect of attention on choices cannot be investigated. Out of sample predictions however show a reasonable account of the data by the model.

The particular application by ([Fisher, 2017](zotero://select/library/items/Q69BEVRF)) where an option is a combination of one aversive and one appetitive food item as a bundle is a strange choice, as each item in the bundle could be thought of as containing many attributes (sweetness, calorie content, flavour match to the alternative item, etc). However one by-product of this stimulus choice is that the result of differential attribute weighting and increased fixation times to aversive “attributes” is indicative of loss aversion ([Kahneman and Tversky, 1984](zotero://select/library/items/LSL2F5IF); Willemsen et al., 2011)

>Although it is well known that fixations and attention can be dissociated (Egly, Driver, & Rafal, 1994; Posner, Nissen, & Ogden, 1977), for the purposes of this experiment fixations appear to provide a reasonable measure of attention at any instance during the choice process.

>I fitted the model at the group level to both choice and reaction time data for all 46 subjects by pooling all even numbered trials into a single data set. The model requires a large amount of data to estimate the parameters accurately, and fitting them at the individual level would result in highly noisy estimates. A similar variant and emphasis of this group estimation procedure has been used in all previous work that estimates parameters from attentional drift diffusion models [(p. 38)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ED9LIJA?page=38&annotation=D74H2JNX)

>In each simulation, individual liking ratings for both the appetitive and aversive foods were drawn from the empirical distribution of liking ratings conditional on the rating of the bundle. Furthermore, once a pair of liking ratings was drawn, I chose subject-estimated regression weights (b0, bP, and bN) associated with the randomly selected simulated liking ratings. For instance, if the drawn liking rating for the appetitive item and the aversive item was drawn and belonged to subject i, then subject i’s regression weights were used throughout the simulated trial.
