## My Thoughts

Danielle Navarro et. al. presents an approach that goes beyond simple averaging across people, or modelling each individual separately in order to discover distinct subgroups of participants that could differ in the parameters of some individual model.

This is achieved by using stick-breaking priors and Dirichlet processes to model a possibly infinite number of subgroups or subjects. This is distinct from my work with [[PMwG]] and a [[Dirichlet process]] on the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice|veridical choice modelling paper]] as the underlying models all seem to have the same form, whereas I have different possible individual models combining parameters in different ways for each model. I also focus on 5 possible subgroups, not an infinitely (in theory) large number of subgroups.

>The potential benefit of averaging data is that, if the performance of subjects really is the same except for noise, the averaging process will tend to remove the effects of the noise, and the resultant data will more accurately reflect the underlying psychological phenomenon.

>Cognitive modeling that attempts to accommodate individual differences usually assumes that each subject behaves in accordance with a unique parameterization of a model, and so evaluation is undertaken against the data from each subject independently [(p. 102)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XRCNINZ5?page=102&annotation=DDHQ4ZKZ)

>Although this avoids the problem of corrupting the underlying pattern of the data, it also foregoes the potential benefits of averaging, and guarantees that modeling is affected by all of the noise in the data [(p. 102)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XRCNINZ5?page=102&annotation=9MU4ZVEG)
