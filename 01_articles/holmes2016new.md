## Item Notes
### High Level Overview

Introduces the PLBA (Piecewise [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]]) model, which the traditional LBA is
a subset of. At some point in time (in this case the point at which an
RDM direction switches) the threshold or drift rate parameters can be
re-sampled to indicate the accumulation of new information introduced to
a decision process. This is an attempt to model decision in the presence
of changing information.

### Detailed Notes

The paper introduces the model and the experimental paradigm of an RDM
that includes a switch in direction on a proportion of trials.

The switch point for the RDM direction is chosen to be situated at
approximately half way through the median response time for an RDM with
a stable direction. This switch point is adapted per participant and per
block to allow for between subject effects as well as fatigue/practice
effects.

The traditional LBA model was compared using the model selection
criteria DIC, to account for differing levels of model complexity to
each of 6 other instantiations of the PLBA. 3 of the 6 restricted the
re-sampled drift rate/threshold to be symmetric between first and second
halves of the switch stimuli. The other 3 PLBA models did not restrict
the second half drift rates, they were just re-sampled from the entire
distribution without restriction. For each of the three symmetric or
freely varying PLBA models there was one which allowed drift rates to
switch at some variable time after the stimulus switch, one which
allowed the threshold to switch after a variable time post stimulus
change and a final one that allowed the drift rate to switch after a
variable time post switch, but the threshold whilst being allowed to
change only changed at switch time.

### Relevance to my work

As stated within the paper this approach could be used in situations
where you have not a change in the stimulus per say, but some indication
of when separate attributes of a stimulus are being perceived.

For instance in the case of multi-attribute decisions, say for a
discrete choice experiment, if there is eye tracking data indicating
when each attribute was first attended to, then a defined point in time
for which a change in the accumulation process could be specified.

Problems: This would be difficult when we have no idea when different
information becomes available for the participant.
