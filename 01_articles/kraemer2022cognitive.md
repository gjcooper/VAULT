## My Thoughts

A nice review of the confluence of memory effects on preferential choices. The neuro-correlates of the decision making processes and the memory aspects of such did go over my head, however there are some nice studies here looking at a memory encoding stage of a task, distractor task and then a preferential choice task. The memory retrieval in the preferential choice task has an effect where poorer options are chosen in the last task if they are remembered, compared to unremembered items (as long as the item remembered is not "too" bad).

Meta-cognitively people estimated their memory as better when the value of an item was higher. Additionally their objective memory recall showed a U shaped pattern with the highest and lowest value options showing stronger recall. The memory effect can be separable from any attention specific effects. Finally the memory effects seem related to the effects of uncertainty on preferential decisions, as they follow the same pattern of a the bias being less pronounced in the loss domain compared to the gain.
