# Stronger attentional biases can be linked to higher reward rate in preferential choice

Zilker, V. (2022). Stronger attentional biases can be linked to higher reward rate in preferential choice. _Cognition_, _225_, 105095. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105095](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105095)

## My Thoughts

YES!. I really like this use of reward rate as a test of the model suitability as opposed to just the "accuracy" w.r.t picking the higher value option in 2AFC. i do have some questions about the large amount of focus on attentional biases to higher valued targets, which seems to add a lot of content without adding to substance, but perhaps i could be convinced.

That is I can;t see a way to "pre-allocate" attention to higher value targets, but I guess in longer timed trials the amount of attention can be directed to a higher valued target through adaptation to higher value attributes. This is more in respect to the simulation work though.

For the empirical re-analyses I can see some benefit in splitting the trials into ones where more attention was paid to higher (or lower) valued targets and investigating the effects of this attention on accuracy and reward rate.

Some possible refs to #follow up on, and I particularly like the first quote from below about strategies.

>However, holding agents to the normative standard of maximizing accuracy ignores a performance metric that is important in many natural ecologies: the time investment associated with a choice. Work on bounded rationality highlights that simple, fast strategies that function with limited time and information can often fare better than strict accuracy maximization, especially when cognitive and computational resources are limited (e.g., Gigerenzer et al., 1999; Simon, 1956, 1990, 1997).

>A possible answer is provided by one of the classical theories of efficient foraging, the marginal value theorem (Charnov, 1976). This framework posits that organisms should forage for resources in a way that maximizes the reward rate—that is, the rewardobtained per unit of time invested. Because the reward rate quantifies trade-offs between rewards obtained and the time costs of decision making, comparing strategies in terms of reward rate makes it possible to assess whether the higher amount of rewards expected under a given strategy justifies its higher time investment.

>These five ratios between the options’ values can be understood as five different levels of choice difficulty (assuming that it is easier to identify the higher-valued option if the options ’ values differ more strongly).

>Each data set was modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of the aDDM. The model was estimated using an approach proposed by Cavanagh et al. (2014) , which is based on rewriting the aDDM’s equations to describe the rate of change in the decision variable RDV (see Eq. 3), that is, the drift rate, δ, as δ = β0 + β1(gazeB⋅VB gazeA⋅VA)+ β2(gazeA⋅VB gazeB⋅VA).

>In contrast,from the theoretical perspective offered by the aDDM,participants control the drift rate itself to some extent (assuming that they control their attention allocation). The model therefore offers a complementary perspective on how reward rate might be modulated: by searching for information in a biased manner, thus speeding up the decision process.

>However, the aDDM is not the only model of the relationship between attention allocation, preference, and response time (for other approaches see, e.g., Callaway et al., 2021 ; Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, & Vitali, 2020; Shimojo et al., 2003 ; Song, Wang, Zhang, & Li, 2019 ).
