## Item Notes

### High Level Overview

The introduction provides a nice overview of what MDS is, and in
particular attempts made in the past to determine the appropriate metric
and dimensionality of a particluar MDS representation. This is followed
by an examination of the identifiability of different metrics
(City-block (r=1), Euclidean (r = (2, 3, 4...) and non-euclidean metrics
(1\<r\<2)), and the ways to fix certain parameters to account for this
non-identifiability. A discussion of DE-MCMC and Warp III Bridge
Sampling for estimating marginal likelihoods is covered, followed by
some applications of this technique to existing datasets.

### Detailed Notes

The introduction to MDS metrics and dimensionality is fantastic, and
should definitely be reread. The high level overview above covers the
basic points.

The osf site (forked into my account) has code and data for a number of
the examples. Fantastic\!

Some extensions possible here, and perhaps a collaboration with
Quentin/Michael in the future in extending the methods here using PMwG
to use hierarchical methods (parameter estimates and random effects).
Look into re-running same examples using these methods, and then
extending into the real-life examples (Nosofsky's rocks for example)

### Relevance to My Work

Mostly relevant to my Phone MDS 2020 study, looking at using this
framework, perhaps implemented in PMwG with the data there.

Looking at possibly extending it to use the hierarchical bayesian
methodology if implemented in PMwG.
