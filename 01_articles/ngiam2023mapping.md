## My Thoughts

I like the stated goal of this research, and it certainly provides a nice overview of the prominent theories in [[VWM]]. It is not currently directly relevant to my work that I can see.

The way of linking the theories, as "aspects" of a more general theory is OK I guess. However I don't really appreciate the [[neural network]] approach of the specific general theory, and the [[theory map]] that is developed here I don;t believe I ever fully understand. perhaps this is something to return to if i work in VWM or want to look at developing new theories myself.

>This pattern appeared to be unchanged by the addition of simple features to these items, such that the capacity limit seemed to be defined by featureintegrated objects—what is now well-known as the slots model. [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/76VX9JUK?page=4&annotation=YH8JRK3B)

>In opposition to this, others have since found changedetection performance varied with the complexity of the tobe-remembered stimuli (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004)—an indication that it was the number of features, and not the number of objects that determined the capacity limit—what is now well-known as the resources model.

>The initial slots model argued that the ceiling was determined by a fixed number of slots devoted to feature-integrated objects (Luck & Vogel, 1997). Many took this characterization of the capacity limit to suggest the rigid representation of information as objects (the strong object model).

>Proponents of resource models have argued that capacity limits are determined by allocation of resources to features, citing the diminishing capacity with increasingly complex items (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004) [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/76VX9JUK?page=4&annotation=NSI55D93)
