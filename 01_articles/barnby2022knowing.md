## My Thoughts

Can definitely see the parallels to the [[BPD Self-other social model]] work here, just missing the Phase 3 section to look at social contagion issues. I may need to look into the CBM toolbox that attempts model comparison with singular measures of the fit for each model, it sounds like it concurrently fits all models simultaneously, and then ?selects? the winning model, perhaps something to do with [[model responsibility]].

>n experimental settings, more paranoid people attribute more harmful intentions to others, including in scenarios where the partner’s true intentions are ambiguous [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6F5AIET7?page=2&annotation=VXEB2R7C)

>we used a modified social-value orientation approach (SVO, Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011; Murphy & Ackermann, 2014). SVO describes a participant’s social preferences and can be measured using a task where decision outcomes impact both the participant and a notional recipient. Specifically, participants can be classified as being prosocial if they typically prefer equal outcomes, individualistic if they prefer to maximise absolute earnings for themselves, and competitive if they prefer to maximise the relative payoff difference between themselves and a partner [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6F5AIET7?page=3&annotation=94F6WQRS)

>We formalised the influence of a participant’s SVO on their learning about their partner by building and comparing ten Bayesian belief and five heuristic models (Table A.1). We usedphase 1 behaviour to estimate participants’ own SVO, operationalised in terms of parameters of their subjective utility for earnings for themselves and their partner. In phase 2, models either a) integrated a participant’s SVO into their prior beliefs about their partner in a Bayesian updating process, b) used separate prior values for the inferred SVO of a partner (but still used a Bayesian updating process), or c), adopted a heuristic reinforcement learning approach.

>We derived regression estimates (which we refer to as ‘estimates’ in the text) associated with parameters in our statistical models using model averaging (Burnham & Anderson, 1998, 2002; Grueber, Nakagawa, Laws, & Jamieson, 2011), which accounts for the uncer tainty in producing parameter estimates when more than one model is consistent with the observed data [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6F5AIET7?page=4&annotation=5YMFHVRY)

>In the model, a participant’s own SVO (characterised by their αpptm and βpptm) forms the central tendency of their prior beliefs about a partner’s SVO, and the participant’s willingness to update these beliefs in the light of the partner’s choices is governed by standard deviation terms ασ and βσ which parameterize the width of these priors (Fig. 3B & 3C) [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6F5AIET7?page=8&annotation=UG9LY4GU)
