## My Thoughts

A nice comparison of two quite different approaches to modelling multi-attribute preferential choice. Participants in two separate studies were given quite concrete examples (pens in the first study with distinctive features as attributes, muesli bars in the second case that they got to taste test).

The proposed memory based value theory was contrasted with a more traditional multi-attribute value theory in their ability to explain the data. The data had two main stages, and initial stage where a subset of all the options were presented and values for each option were ascribed by the participants, as well as initial learning in the choice task style of the same options. The second main stage of the task was the same as the choice task (choice between option and a monetary value), but now an additional set of options were presented (NEW vs OLD).

The memory based value theory then used similarity (similar to [[GCM]] or [[Peter Juslin]]'s multiple cue judgement learning model (also exemplar based)) to OLD items to improve prediction of choices compared to the [[Weighted Additive Rule|Multiattribute utility model]] style theory.

>A BDM auction is an incentive-compatible value elicitation method. Respondents are asked to provide their true evaluation of a good and are incentivized as follows. At the end of the experiment, a random value is drawn from a uniform distribution over the range of admissible valuations. Participants receive the good if their subjective evaluation exceeds the randomly drawn value, otherwise they receive the value in cash. Thus, participants have an incentive to provide their true subjective value for the good. [(p. 70)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZU5W4NHC?page=70&annotation=DZ36ULF5)

>Specifically, exemplar models differ from our model in that they assume discrete categorical responses, whereas our model is an instance of Juslin et al.’s judgment model combined with a softmax choice rule based on a comparison between the value judgment of the options.
