## My Thoughts

A nice clean investigation of [[test-retest reliability]] of model parameters looking into the parameters of a [[Hierarchical Gaussian Filter]] model of advice taking within a probabilistic game. Both behavioural measures related to [[reinforcement learning]] like **win-stay** and **lose-shift** were poor in the [[Intraclass Correlation Coefficient|ICC]] estimates of test-retest,  and the associated HGF measures estimated using [[tapas]].

Some nice points to consider, I like the writing here. It is clean without distraction and figure heavy withu overexplaining. Additionally there are some references here to chase up regarding possible changes to the study design to improve reliability

>To make sure that our models are recoverable, we repeated this procedure for all other models, while also fitting each model to the data generated by the other models. We then performed random-effects Bayesian model selection (based on the free energy approximation of the Bayesian model evidence) on each of the datasets and averaged the resulting protected exceedance probabilities across the 20 runs to produce a confusion matrix to assess model recovery.
