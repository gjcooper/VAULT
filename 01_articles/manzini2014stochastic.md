# Stochastic Choice and Consideration Sets

## My Thoughts

This work seems to be one of the intial treatises on random utility theory and "no choice" options, or other types of default options. Links to my work on [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]] and the comparison of option [[utlity]] to some "internal aspirational option utility".

>We define a new type of random choice rule by assuming that the agent has a strict preference ordering  on A. The preference  is applied only to a consideration set C(A) ⊆ A of alternatives (the set of alternatives the decision maker pays attention to). We allow for C(A) to be empty, in which case the agent picks the default option a∗, so that p(a∗A) is the probability that C(A) is empty. The membership of C(A) for the alternatives in A is probabilistic. For all A ∈ D, each alternative a has a probability γ(a) ∈ (0 1) of being in C(A).
