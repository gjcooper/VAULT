## My Thoughts

Although i have some questions (marginally significant my arse) there are some nice examples here of people automatically categorising stimuli (graphs, raw numbers etc) into two distinct binary categories (above or below a midpoint for the most part). This binary classification then drives biased estimation of the mean of a set of values. *This biased estimate is actually the **evidence** that the paper uses for this classification*.

>This account shares similarities with another proposed pattern of integration: the tallying heuristic, which involves summing the total number of cues that favor one option over another across multiple dimensions (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). Unlike the tallying heuristic, the binary bias posits categorical thinking along a single dimension and that people discretize a continuous value range.

> This may provide some good framing for my [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|GCM inspired analysis]] as I could think of people as classifying each attribute of continuous values into distinct categories (cheap vs expensive, high vs low quality). The anchor point then is the most expensive/lowest quality option...
