## My Thoughts

Not much of imoirtance here, although future durections in [[reinforcement learning]] could move this way. The links between [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[the study of cognition]] are stronger here than much of the hype arounbd [[large language models]].

>This idea, referred to as episodic RL [29,30,42], parallels ‘nonparametric’ approaches in machine learning [28] and resembles ‘instance-’ or ‘exemplarbased’ theories of learning in psychology [31,32]. [(p. 411)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36EBBE9G?page=411&annotation=37QNC5PA)

>As with episodic deep RL, meta-RL again involves an intimate connection between fast and slow learning. The connections in the recurrent network are updated slowly across tasks, allowing general principles that span tasks to be ‘built into’ the dynamics of the recurrent network. The resulting network dynamics implement a new learning algorithm which can solve new problems quickly, because they have been endowed with useful inductive biases by the underlying process of slow learning (Box 3) [(p. 413)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36EBBE9G?page=413&annotation=DYG7HQEZ)
