## My Thoughts

This paper is an early attempt at some of the work I id in my [[thesis]] where I attempt to classify decision strategies. In some ways this goes further (relating decision strategy choice to the [[entropy]] or [[complexity of choice]]). However one main limitation here is the limited number of decision strategies considered. Indeed the [[non-compensatory]] considered here are modelled using a parameter vector of a standard multinomial logit compensatory model.

>The current article differs from these efforts because it aims at capturing, through modeling, the impact of underlying decision strategy changes made by respondents during the course of a choice task. [(p. 137)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GRCD4FZW?page=137&annotation=IM5Q3XGK)
