# Hugo

Very flexible, but still wrapping my head around it.

Shortcodes seem like a good way to get a component that would be complicated that you can sprinkle through your markdown. I was looking into how to use them as part of just general markdown (heading etc) but this seems a lot more complicated. Probably better to have a general CSS style for all components, and then in special cases i can add a shortcode for that.
