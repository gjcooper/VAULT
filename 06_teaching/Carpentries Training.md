# Day 1

## Buiding Skill with practice

- Carpentries workshops are designed to be interactive
- Skill levels:
    - Novice (do not know what they don't know)
    - Competent Practitioner (Enough understanding, still needs to look things up)
    - Expert (Daily user, confident to solve problems using learned skills)
- Different skill levels will have a different mental model of the concepts involved
- Excalidraw.com is pretty good at drawing concept maps etc
- Differnt misconceptions people can have:
    - Factual Erros - easy to fix
    - Broken models - harder to fix
    - Fundamental beliefs - very difficult to fix, example would be I'm not a computational person.
- Formative assessment to identify misconceptions (Small assessment items during the learning process (as opposed to summative - like exams, essays etc))
- Importance of going slowly

## Expertise and Instruction

- Experts can have trouble teaching if they are not aware of the gap in knowledge between themselves and learners.
- Experts need to be aware of switching language, using terms interchangeably, especially without introducing the ew terms and
talking about the differences/equivalences.
- When you encoutner a problem/error, be careful to work through the solution slowly and purposefully.
- Avoid "just" and other dismissive laguage that dismissing the issue speople may be having.
- The problems you encoutnered while learning may not be the same for your students.

## Memory and Cognitive Load

- Short-term vs long-term memory
<https://miku.github.io/activememory/>
- Strategies for Memory Management:
    - Chunking (grouping items based on relatedness)
    - Formative assessment to support memory consolidation
    - Group work - allows people to explain their own work
    - Opportunities for reflection
- Cognitive load and limited attention, People need to attend to three things when learning:
    - Intrinsic (have to think about to perform a task)
    - Germane, effort required to connect the task to new and old information
    - Extrinsic, distractions and irrelevant effort
- Attention Management:
    - Use formative assessments, faded examples, labelling diagrams
    - Do not display curriculum materials, speak commands as you type them
    - Maybe a running glossary of commands

## Building Skill with Feedback

- Pre and post course surveys
- Perhaps give time in the lesson for the post-course survey
- Minute cards (positive and negative comments \< 1 minute on post-it: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview>
- One up, One down - 1 pos, 1 neg different from what has already been said.

# Day 2

## Motivation and Demotivation

- If learners are not motivated nothing else will work
- Avoid doing harm:
    - Do not talk with scorn about any tool or practice (or people who use a tool)
    - Dive into anything too complex that is unnecessary, leave that for breaks/follow-up
    - pretend to know more than you do
    - Use trivialising language (just)
    - Take over a learners keyboard.
    - Express surprise at unawareness.
- Cultivate motivation to continue learning.
- Content that is easier to learn and immediately useful is much more motivating
- Invite participation:
    - Establishing norms for interaction, enforcing a code of conduct
    - Encouraging learners to learn from each other
    - Acknowledge when learners are confused
- Encourage a growth mindset:
    - positive error framing
    - Presenting the instructor as a learner
    - Praising effort or improvement, not performance or ability.

## Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

- Definitions:
    - Equity - proportional distribution of desirable outcomes.
    - Inclusion - actively engaging traditionally excluded groups.
    - Accessibility - tools/policies designed to improve inclusion/access
- Carpentries core values <https://carpentries.org/values/>
- Curb-cut effect, when designing for increased access for disadvantaged, we often improve the situation for everyone.
- Stereotypes:
    - Can be explicit or implicit
    - Can be beneficial (facilitate quick judgements like stopping child from driving a car)
    - Often can lead to negative attitudes or behaviours
- Stereotypes about learners by instructors:
    - call attention to differences unnecessarily
    - give more/less attention to some learners
    - respond differently to certain learners
- Stereotypes learners have about themselves:
    - develop fixed mindset about capabilities
    - increase cognitive load (stereotype threat)

## Teaching is a skill

- Talked about feedback.
- When asking for feedback:
    - Initiate avenues for feedback to be given
    - Ask for feedback in a specific form
- Providing feedback:
    - balance positive and negative ffedback
    - Provide a clear next step to address negative feedback
- Receiving feedback:
  - use a feedback translator

## Wrap-up and Homework

- [x] Read about [centrally-organized and self-organized
workshops.](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising)
- [x] Read about [teaching and Hosting workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html)
- [x] Think of a question about organising and running workshops
  - With the move towards online delivery of workshops it looks as if the delivery has moved to 4 half days rather than 2 full days. How has this affected attendance for the courses? (As everyone always has too much on their plate anyway)
- [x] prepare for live coding

# Day 3

## Welcome Back

- Review and refresh

## Getting Started on Instructor Certification

- 3 steps to become certified after the course:
    - Make a small contribution to a lesson or the glossary
    - Take part in an online discussion
    - Take part in an online teaching demonstration.

## The Carpentries: How We Operate

- How the carpentries is organised and how to run a carpentries workshop

## Live Coding Is a Skill

Disadvantage - talking and coding at the same time - could get confused and make mistakes more esily Disadvantage - If you are used to a highly customised interface you could be rusty in a more beginner oriented IDE/editor

- Demonstrate live coding

## Preparing to Teach

Postgraduate student, possibly international who is studying a field that does not provide training in computational techniques. They may have lagnuage barriers, or have had limited exposure to computation thinking in the past and need plenty of encouragement and demonstration of points of contact with their own work.
