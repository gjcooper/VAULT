# Messy

An [[R]] package that takes a clean dataset and introduces messiness to it. This can be simple or more specific.

Examples of the specific messiness that can be introduced are random special characters in text columns, removing items from columns (missing values - either by NA, a sentinel value or just no value), mangling column names and more.

In particular this may be helpful for generating test cases for the [[Hypatia Work|Hypatia Health beta]] app in future when I am looking at testing for edge cases in uploaded data.
