# Hugo

Very flexible, but still wrapping my head around it.

Shortcodes seem like a good way to get a component that would be complicated that you can sprinkle through your markdown. I was looking into how to use them as part of just general markdown (heading etc) but this seems a lot more complicated. Probably better to have a general CSS style for all components, and then in special cases i can add a shortcode for that.

## Notes on working with hugo

Working on my [[hugo]] module version of the lab site, and I am still having problems getting [[tailwindcss]] to see changes in the layout html.

Finally have it working.

To work in dev use the methods in https://www.thenewdynamic.com/note/develop-hugo-modules-locally/

Follow the module methods in: https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-importing-a-theme/

Make sure you have postcss and tailwind config files in theme module.

package.hugo.json in theme should match package.json from: https://github.com/bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic

You import a theme in the hugo site using https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-importing-a-theme/#import-the-theme-module.

Then in the hugo site you run

```sh
hugo mod npm pack
npm install
```

CSS is generated by postcss, you do not need to use the tailwind cli. To make this work it is necessary to have the hugo postcss commands in a partial or \_default layout file. As in https://github.com/bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic/blob/master/layouts/_default/baseof.html
