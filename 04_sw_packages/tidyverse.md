# tidyverse

The tidyverse is a name given to a collection of [[R]] packages that share a set of core maintainers and  core philosophy. The most commonly known packages are ggplot2, dplyr and tidyr. However there are many other packages in the ecosystem that either facilitate these main packages or provide further functionality for more niche operations.

## ggplot2

This visualisation library follows a principle called the [[grammar of graphics]]. One of the most popular implementations of this visualisation philosophy is ggplot2. The way of working with ggplot2 is to build up layers of data, representations and then adjust scales and formats.

## dplyr and tidyr

These two packages go hand in hand. `dplyr` is all about filtering, sorting and mutating rows and columns of a data frame. `tidyr` is all about reshaping data frames, that is pivoting them to a wider or longer format.
