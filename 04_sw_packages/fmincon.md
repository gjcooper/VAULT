# fmincon

fmincon is a MATLAB function from the Optimisation toolbox that finds the minimum of constrained nonlinear multivariable functions.

It is a [[gradient descent]] based method designed to work on problems where the objective and constraint functions are continuous (and have continuous first derivatives). It can be run in parallel. There is a rough R package equivalent called `nloptr`
