# cpm

Luca was the person who I talked to


# Next steps in my career

What do I want to do if this job with Joe doesn't work out.

- Location - would be nice to stay in Newcastle region given Alisha loves her job.
- Field - Do I apply for grants, do I apply for a post-doc job in a local lab? How cloce to cognitive modelling does the position really have to be? Could I look at economic modelling, linguistic modelling, some other tangentially related field?
- Do i move out of academia and into industry? How flexible do I want my work and is academia that relevant to me longer term?

## SocR Lab Meeting

Hayley Dorfman (.com/github etc) has a nice talk on bayesian reinforcement learning models and beliefs about control (how much control an agent/person has over the outcomes). One attendee from Tufts (rmirsk01@tufts.edu) had an interesting question about control and artificial agents that put me in mind of the Trust in AI group at Newcastle.
