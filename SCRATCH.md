Descriptive/statistical analysis for studies 2 and 3, did the manipulation work? In the HH/LL cells did they accept more than in distractor cells? Maybe instead of 3x3 ANOVA use something like an attribute specific logistic regression

For th two option case does the _difference_ in attribute levels predict choice

KL-divergence between distributions feed into drift rate DDM and social cognition
