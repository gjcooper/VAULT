# SCRATCH PAD

_Notes placed here should be cleaned out regularly into the appropriate places, or actioned upon and removed_


Descriptive/statistical analysis for studies 2 and 3, did the manipulation work? In the HH/LL cells did they accept more than in distractor cells? Maybe instead of 3x3 ANOVA use something like an attribute specific logistic regression

For th two option case does the _difference_ in attribute levels predict choice

## shower thoughts

Should we add win-stay lose-shift outputs to displays?

## Used response sections hypatia

data.trials
data.choice_prop
data.mean_reward

# Notes from Alex

- Variational Bayes easily done in stan when have the model written. Much faster, but no guarantee of model converence like MCMC.
- CmdStanR executables created that are interfaced with R, rather than within R 
- Classic task papers: 
    - [[pizzagalli2008reduced|Pizzagalli SDT with bias affected by rewards]]
    - [[hird2024movement|Hird's review article on exercise and depression that links to several effort-based reward tasks]]
    - Volatility tasks: [[pulcu2017affective|A volatility RL task that independently manipulates win/loss probability]]

### Confusion matrix, recovery from simulation scatterplot??

- to recover reward and punishment learning rates properly it may be best to have reward and punishment rates anti-correlated
- reward sensitivity and inverse temperature are confusable.
- model confusability.
- Claim that Subset of people who have no Model of the environment in the two-step task, would need to show model recoverability.

## project idea 

Using Jess's work on separating out response style from true distributions, does this change the [[test-retest reliability]] of typical psychiatric battery tests like depression scales etc. These typically have high reliability compared to behavioural tasks, important for individual differences research, but works this call it into question.

## Climate change talk

Collective risk social dilemma sounds like an interesting task.
