# The Generalised Context Model

This model was developed by Nosofsky, and is outlined in detail in [[nosofsky2011generalized|The generalized context model: an exemplar model of classification]].

The rough summary of this approach is that memory for objects is done in relation to exemplars in each category of object type.
