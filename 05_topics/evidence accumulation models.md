# Evidence Accumulation Models

These models take the view that decisions, particularly faster perceptual decisions can be viewed as the accumulation over time towards one or more thresholds for the decision.

Often used in [[two-alternative forced choice|2AFC]] paradigms, the evidence accumulation models come in two flavours, the random walk/diffusion models like the [[diffusion decision model|DDM]] that look at relative evidence, and the accumulator models like the [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]] that look at absolute evidence.

The paper: [[ratcliff2016diffusion|Diffusion Decision Model: Current Issues and History]] has a good schematic of the different models.

These models have been used with memory processes, noisy evidence from the signal/stimulus and more.

The paper: [[hawkins2023standard|The standard relationship between choice frequency and choice time is violated in multi-attribute preferential choice]] details how the increasing use of evidence accumulation models in [[Preferential Choice]] is perhaps misguided.
