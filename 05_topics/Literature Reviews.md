There many flavours of literature reviews, including:
- Narrative Literature Reviews
- Meta-analysis reviews
- Systematic Literature Reviews

The [Griffith University lit review course](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-environment-science/research/systematic-quantitative-literature-review) provides a brief summary of these different styles and covers the steps in their Systematic Quantitative Literature Review structure.

Narrative reviews are more easily generated by someone intimately aware of a field, who can draw upon years of experience to draw together the different threads of current debates and historical contexts for the review. Meta-analyses are a much more intensive process often undertaken by large teams that involves the synthesis of many results sections and advanced analytical techniques that can account for publication biases, assessments of source (journal) quality and more.

The Systematic (Quantitative) literature review is a step-by-step outline of a way to gather and synthesise output - with the highly structured methods providing a lot of assistance to early career researchers and PhD candidates.
