# R

A statistical programming language that is fantastic for interacting with data in an intuitive way. Being the programming language of choice for a lot of statisticians, new methods are often implemented here before being transported or implemented in other more general programming languages such as [[Python]].

A core component of the language that makes working with data easy is the `data.frame`, which is a table that has columns that enforce all the same data type and rows that generally correspond to a record. (One participant, one trial etc).

## Major packages 

A large part of the success of R in recent years can likely be traced to the popularity of the [[tidyverse]], a collection of R packages designed to work well together for data wrangling and visualisation.
