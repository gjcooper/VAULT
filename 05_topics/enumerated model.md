# Enumerated model

The *enumerated model* from [[hawkins2014integrating]] is a horse race model for [[best-worst scaling]] choices where there are $n \times (n-1)$. Each accumulator corresponds to a pair of attribute values, and the first accumulator to hit threshold determines both the best and worst attribute value.
