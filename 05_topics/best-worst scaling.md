# Best-Worst Scaling

Best worst scaling is a preference elicitation task design ([[Preferential Choice]]) that has options arrayed, usually across the screen, with features (attributes) of each option listed in columns for each option.

It can be contrasted with [[Discrete Choice Experiments]] where instead of a subject or consumer providing their overall preferred option they provide both the **best** (overall most preferred) _and_ their **worst** (overall least preferred) option.

This means for each choice set, there are now two decisions, and indeed if the choice set is three options then the two choices provide a fully ranked set.
