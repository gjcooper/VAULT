# Hyperbolic discounting

Hyperbolic discounting is a form of [[delay-discounting]]. As delays in receiving rewards increase, the perceived value of the reward decreases. However in contrast to exponential discounting, over the long term the reward value is higher. In the short term however there is a sharper decline in perceived value for short - medium term delays.
