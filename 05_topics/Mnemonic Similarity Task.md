# Mnemonic Similarity Task

A series of object images are given during a training phase, say a rubber duck, a metal mailbox and an apple. The test phase then has repeated images (same rubber duck image), foil images (metal watering can, similar colours and shape) and lure images (a different apple image with highly similar features).

One possible outcome measure is the Lure Discrimination Index, responding "similar" to lure items - responding "similar" to foil items
