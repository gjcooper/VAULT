# Readings in probability theory


I'm working through resources, primarily in Michael Betancourt's work to try and gain a deeper understanding of probability theory and associated applications.

- Initially I am reading the first chapter of his updated online book, about [[Probability on Finite Sets]].
- The second chapter extends this initial grounding in finite sets to the more general [[Mathematical Spaces]]
- The third chapter moves from one space at a time, to multiple spaces at a time, or [[Product Spaces]]
- Chapter four returns to probability, now extending to non-finite cases, [[Probability of General Spaces]]
