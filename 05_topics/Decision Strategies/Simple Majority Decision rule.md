# Simple Majority Decision Rule

This decision strategy is basically the same as the [[Dominance strategy]], however the decision maker always chooses an alternative. The chosen alternative is the one which has the highest number of dominating attributes. Thus for alternatives A and B with A better on one attribute, and B better on two attributes, then B is selected.
