# Compatibility Test

Coming from *Image theory* in [Beach and Mitchell (1978)](#beach87) and formalised as *compatibility test* by [Beach in 1990](#beach90), this decision strategy is one that operates by eliminating alternatives. The general idea is that an alternative is eliminated if its attribute levels violate the corresponding aspiration levels more than $k$ times, where $k$ is specific to the decision maker.

$\sum_{i=1}^m \mathit{asp}(a_{ij}) > k$

Nothing is specified what happens in a decision if no alternative meets this threshold, or how to decide between each option if multiple ones meet the threshold.
