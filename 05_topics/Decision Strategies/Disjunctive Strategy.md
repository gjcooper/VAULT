# Disjunctive Strategy

Another elimination strategy proposed by [Coombs and Kao (1955)](#coombs55), this strategy complements the conjunctive strategy as the decision maker will eliminate an alternative if all of its attribute values do not meet their respective [[aspiration level]].

$$
\sum_{i=1}^m \mathit{asp}(a_{ij}) = m
$$

This means that the disjunctive strategy, the compatibility test and the conjunctive strategy all fall along a spectrum, by eliminating an alternative if all, some or at least one attribute fails to meet the aspiration level.
