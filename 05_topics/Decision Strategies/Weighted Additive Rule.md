# Weighted Additive Rule


Primary source is [Tversky 1969](#tversky69), other names are the *Additive model* ([Fishburn 1970](#fishburn70)), the *Addition of utilities rule* ([Todd and Benbasat 1991](#todd91)) and possibly most commonly the *Multiattribute utility model* ([Montgomery and Svenson 1976](#montgomery76))

Perhaps can be assumed as the standard decision strategy in economics, assumes people compute a utility for each alternative. Utility is sum of weighted attribute values.

$$
\mathrm{max}_{j = 1..n} [
        u(\mathit{alt}_j) = \sum_{i=1}^m w_iv_i(a_{ij})
    ]
$$

In my work on the [[Architecture of MultiAttribute Choice]], I've argued that a form of the Weighted Additive Rule could be adapted for [[consideration sets|screening choices]] by assuming that the computed option utility for each option under consideration could be assessed against some ideal preferential option [[utility]], ie some internal state of what and acceptable option utility would be.
