# Weighted Additive Rule


Primary source is [Tversky 1969](#tversky69), other names are the *Additive model* ([Fishburn 1970](#fishburn70)), the *Addition of utilities rule* ([Todd and Benbasat 1991](#todd91)) and possibly most commonly the *Multiattribute utility model* ([Montgomery and Svenson 1976](#montgomery76))

Perhaps can be assumed as the standard decision strategy in economics, assumes people compute a utility for each alternative. Utility is sum of weighted attribute values.
