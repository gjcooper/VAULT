# Equal Weight Heuristic


First proposed as *Dawes rule* by [Dawes and Corrigan 1974](#dawes74),
and named as the *Equal Weight Heuristic* by [Einhorn and Hogharth in 1981](#einhorn75), this decision strategy has also been known as the *Equal weight linear model* in [Dawes (1979)](#dawes79) and the *Equal
weighting rule* in [Thorngate (1980)](#thorngate80).

Highest utility determines selected alternative. Each attribute is
assumed to be of equal importance to decision makers, thus utility is
sum of all attribute values:

$$
\mathrm{max}_{j = 1..n}[
        u(\mathit{alt}_j) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} v_i(a_{ij})
    ]
$$
