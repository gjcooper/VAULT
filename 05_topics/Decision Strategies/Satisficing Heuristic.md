# Satisficing Heuristic

Introduced by [H. Simon in 1955](#simon55) the *satisficing heuristic* is a strategy whereby decision makers are assumed to consider alternatives sequentially in the order in which they occur in the choice task. The decision is made as soon as alternative is reached that meets all aspiration levels ($\forall i\; \mathit{asp}(a_{ij}) = 0$)

In contrast to the conjunctive strategy the decision maker will stop early at the first alternative that meets all aspiration levels.
