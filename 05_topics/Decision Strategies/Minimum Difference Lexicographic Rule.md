# Minimum Difference Lexicographic Rule

Proposed as the *Lexicographic semiorder strategy* by [Luce (1956)](#luce56), this strategy was also covered and renamed the *minimum difference lexicographic rule* by [Montgomery and Svenson (1976)](#montgomery76). This strategy is quite similar to the lexicographic heuristic, however two attribute values $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ik}$ are said to be equal if $v_i(a_{ij}) - v_i(a_{ik}) < \Delta_i$, where $\Delta_i$ is a threshold above which a decision maker notices a difference between two attribute values
