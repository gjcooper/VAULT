# Conjunctive Strategy

Originally discussed by [Coombs and Kao (1955)](#coombs55) the conjunctive strategy is the special case of the [[Compatibility Test]] where $k$ is fixed at 1, that is an alternative is removed if at least 1 attribute does not meet the [[aspiration level]].

$$
\sum_{i=1}^m \mathit{asp}(a_{ij}) >= k
$$
