# Satisficing-plus Heuristic

A variant to the Satisficing heuristic introduced by [Park (1978)](#park78), this extends the satisficing heuristic to the situation where decision makers only consider some subset of attributes, of size $m^*$. They then choose the alternative that meets the [[aspiration level]] on all $m^*$ of those attributes.
