# Dominance Strategy

Proposed by [Lee (1971)](#lee71) the *dominance strategy* is one where the chosen alternative dominates all other alternatives. An alternative $\mathit{alt}_k$ is said to dominate $\mathit{alt}_l$ if all [[attribute value|attribute values]] are as good or better. That is:

$$
\forall i \; v_i(a_{ik}) >= v_i(a_{il}) \land
       \exists i v_i(a_{ik}) > v_i(a_{il})
$$

If no alternative dominates the others, then no choice is made.
