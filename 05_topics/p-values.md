How should we interpret p-values and how are they actually interpreted in the literature and the wider scientific discourse?

As taken from lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/01-pvalue.html the way a p-value should be interpreted is:

> We claim there is a/no meaningful effect, while acknowledging that if scientists make claims using this methodological procedure, they will be misled, in the long run, at most alpha % or beta % of the time, which we deem acceptable. We will for the foreseeable future, until new data or information emerges that proves us wrong, assume this claim is correct.
