# Rescorla-Wagna rule

The RW rule is based on classical or [[Pavlovian]] conditioning where reinforcements of behaviour are independent of the agent (usually animals) behaviour. The opposing view, sometimes called instrumental or [[operant conditioning]] occurs when reinforcement (rewards or punishment) are dependent on the agents actions.

Both of these (Pavlovian or operant) conditioning are examples of [[reinforcement learning]].

The name-brand recognition of the Rescorla-Wagner rule has seen it shift from purely animal/pavlovian conditioning to be synonymous with similar reinforcement learning models, such as [[Q-learning]]. In truth though at it's core it is a different model that focuses on learned associations between a [[conditioned stimulus]] and an [[unconditioned stimulus]].
