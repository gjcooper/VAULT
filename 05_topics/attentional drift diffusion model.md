# Drift rates influenced by attention

However in all cases I've seen what they use as a proxy for attention is the proportion or periods of fixation time to regions (aka attributes in most cases) within the display.

Being a [[diffusion decision model|diffusion model]] it is of course following quite closely along the traditions and underlying model approach of [[Roger Ratcliff]]'s work.
