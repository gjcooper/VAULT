## Overview

The take the best algorithm ranks the possible cues according to their validity, then assesses the alternatives on the highest ranked cue. If there is a clear winner, take that alternative, otherwise either check the next cue, or if no more cues are available then guess.

I equate this model of decision making to the [[Satisficing Heuristic]] and [[Satisficing-plus Heuristic]], however the focus from that work seems to be on deciding between options based on the attributes meeting all aspiration levels, but here the Take the best is deciding between alternatives based on the first matching cue. TTB is also ranking cues based on validity, and satisficing is assessing options in presented order.
