More detail needed, but it seems there are at least two phases of this cognitive test. Each phase uses geometric forms displayed on a screen, with a matching phase there one form is show centrall for 10 seconds, followed by a decision task between two similar geometric forms, the decision being which one matches the prompt.

The other phase is a recognition phase, where items are shown and a Yes/No decision needs to be made as to whether the participants recognises the geometric form displayed.
