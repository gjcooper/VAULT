In the context of choices a static choice model takes each choice as independent and particularly with no dynamics within the choice process. A model that incorporates dynamics however (such as the [[Sequential sampling models]]) links choice reaction times and the choices people make. This allows for patterns such as fast errors, [[Speed Accuracy trade-off]]'s, differing choice patterns depending on time pressure and other dynamics exhibited in peoples responses in many paradigms.
