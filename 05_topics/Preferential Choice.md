# Preferential Choice

Preferential choice in this context refers to a task design where the subject is assumed to be exhibiting behaviours that reveal their personal preferences for one option of one or more others.

Much of the [[consumer choice]] literature designs tasks aimed at eliciting subjects preferences for one product or service over the other. Other avenues of research that use this task type are places like [[Risky Choice]] (exhibiting preferences for different levels of risk/reward), perhaps [[moral choice]] (choosing one ethical approach over others) and more.
