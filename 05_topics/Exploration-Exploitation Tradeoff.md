# Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off

The Exploration/Exploitation trade-off describes the tension that decision makers face when selecting between alternatives with known good outcomes and alternatives with unknown, but potentially better outcomes. Normally, this trade-off is examined using so-called “bandit tasks”. In these tasks, participants are presented a number of alternatives with differing, unknown values. Participants then choose between these alternatives with the goal of maximizing reward, requiring that they balance between choosing the best known option (exploitation) and sampling novel options (exploration). One key issue with this task is that it is not always possible to tell whether a participant’s choice reflects an exploratory choice, an exploitative choice, or indeed some combination of the two. The current talk proposes a novel task in which we distinctly separate exploration and exploitation into discrete phases. In doing this, we aim to more directly tap the strategies that underlie these two processes.
