# Random Utility Models

A class of models that attempt to account for choices that don't follow the "rational" [[utility]] maximisation. They include additional random error terms to account for unaccounted for preferences, imperfect perception, aggregation effects and any other aspect of the choice set that isn't captured by the recorded data and stated preferences.
