# MMN

The MMN or mismatch negativity is a difference waveform, typically studied in a auditory context. Typically calculated by taking the average ERP response to an occasional deviant tone away from the average ERP response to a predictable standard tone.

The MMN is reduced in people with #subject/schizophrenia , older adults and sometimes under pharmacological interventions such as under the effects of ketamine.
