# Parallel model

The *parallel model* from [[hawkins2014integrating]] is a horse race model for [[best-worst scaling]] choices where there are two races. It is analogous to the [[sequential model]], but instead of the races being consecutive, the best and worst races are run at the same time.

The first accumulator to finish in the best race is assigned to the best attribute. The first to reach threshold in the worst race is assigned to the worst attribute/option.

Of note is that the parallel model does not restrict the same option/attribute from winning both races (can be both best and worst), although the task from Hawkins did not allow this type of responding.

The time difference between best and worst responses is also not well captured by this model, as the difference between the two response types can be arbitrarily small.
