Given the conditions for a choice (utilities/preferences) a deterministic choice is one where the choice action is carried out disregarding and degree of difference between the options. Stochastic choice though is one where two options sufficiently similar will have a relative probability of being chosen of 50:50. One prominent example of stochastic choice is something like the [[Luce choice axiom|Luce Choice rule]]
