# The study of Categorisation

Categories are an essential part of the human experience by which we communicate and navigate the world. Over the years the study of categorisation has many branches with two main camps utilising the [[Exemplar model of categorisation]] and others using the [[Prototype model of categorisation]].
These two models use the same underlying idea of a [[psychological space]] as a representation of the elements being categorised, however the ways in which a new element is assigned to a category varies between them. 
# Categorisation

The psychological study of how people form categories of objects, typically based on their features that they share in common with other members of the categories. Other aspects include of the study of [[category learning]] (how people learn about categories), categorical decision making and more.

Two large classes of models of categorisation include the [[Robert M Nosofsky|Nosofsky]] model, outlined in [[nosofsky2011generalized|The generalized context model: an exemplar model of classification]].

Another alternative is the prototype model of categorisation, argued for by such people as [[Peter Juslin]], and contrasted with the exemplar model and others in [[smith2014prototypes|Prototypes, exemplars, and the natural history of categorization]].
