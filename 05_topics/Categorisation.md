# Categorisation

The psychological study of how people form categories of objects, typically based on their features that they share in common with other members of the categories. Other aspects include of the study of [[category learning]] (how people learn about categories), categorical decision making and more.

Two large classes of models of categorisation include the [[Robert M Nosofsky|Nosofsky]] model, outlined in [[nosofsky2011generalized|The generalized context model: an exemplar model of classification]].

Another alternative is the prototype model of categorisation, argued for by such people as [[Peter Juslin]], and contrasted with the exemplar model and others in [[smith2014prototypes|Prototypes, exemplars, and the natural history of categorization]].
