# 2AFC

The two alternative forced choice task type is a generic term for any kind of choice task where the the subject is "forced" to choose between two and only two alternatives. There is also no deferral of choice allowed, although often tasks will have elements such as a time-out (a trial ends after a set time with no response).

Used throughout a lot of perceptual work, and one of the prominent places I have seen it is in the application of [[evidence accumulation models]] such as the [[diffusion decision model|DDM]] and the [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]]. In fact the original DDM relied on the task being a 2AFC task as the evidence was assumed to accumulate towards a lower and upper boundary, with one boundary corresponding to one choice and the other boundary corresponding to the other choice.
