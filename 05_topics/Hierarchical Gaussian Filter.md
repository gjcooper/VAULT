# HGF

The HGF is an improvement on the reinforcement learning analysis, where a participants sensory input drives levels of learning about trial to trial prediction errors, as well as higher level volatility in the environment, as well as changes to that over time.

Used in some [[Mismatch Negativity]] research with [[Juanita Todd]], as well as some analysis of the [[Helicopter Predictive Inference Task]] with [[Laura Wall]] and Juanita.
