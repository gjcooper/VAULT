# Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning can refer to the general artificial intelligence approach, which is well covered by the Sutton and Barto book [[sutton2020reinforcement|Reinforcement learning: an introduction]]. Alternatively it could refer to the application of this model to human (or animal) psychology. That is, in an uncertain environment, with rewards (gains or losses) as outcomes for certain actions, how does an individual subject learn about the volatility in that environment.

A specific example of a simple model used in reinforcement learning is the [[Q-learning]] model, which is being implemented as part of the [[Hypatia Work|Hypatia Health beta]]. A closely related model is the [[Rescorla-Wagna]] model.
