# Elementary Information Processes

These EIPs were proposed by [[Eric J. Johnson]] and [[John W. Payne]] in 1985 as a way of decomposing a multiattribute decision into subcomponents to enable an assessment of the computational complexity of various strategies and decisions.

The standard collection of sub-components/processes are:

**Read**: Read a value into working memory
**Compare**: Compare two alternatives on an attribute
**Difference**: Calculate the size of the difference between alternatives on an attribute.
**Add**: Add values of an attribute in working memory
**Product**: Weight one value on an attribute in working memory.
**Eliminate**: Remove and alternative or attribute from consideration
**Move**: go to the next element of an external environment
**Choose**: Announce preferred alternative and stop processing.
