# Gibbs sampling

This [[MCMC]] sampling algorithm is a special case of the [[Metropolis-Hastings]] algorithm. It is applicable when the joint distribution of parmaeters ois not known or is difficult to sample from, but the conditional distribution is known and is easier. [[JAGS]] is an example piece of software that implements Gibbs sampling for estimation.
