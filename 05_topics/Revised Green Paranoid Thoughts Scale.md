# Revised Green et al Paranoid Thought Scale

Assesses paranoid thoughts including social reference (subscale A) and persecution (subscale B). The revised version of the scale ([[freeman2021revised|The revised Green et al., Paranoid Thoughts Scale (R-GPTS): psychometric properties, severity ranges, and clinical cut-offs]]) has been shown to have good psychometric properties after an analysis of previously collected data showed some substandard psychometric properties (issues with the loading onto a factor structure) for the original scale.
