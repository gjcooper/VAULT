# DCE Information


## Sample Size

From "Sample Size requirements for Discrete Choice Experiments in
Healthcare: A Practical Guide":

The rule of thumb from Johnson and Orme is provided in this excerpt:

> In short, the rule of thumb as proposed by Johnson and Orme \[37, 38\]
> suggests that the sample size required for the main effects depends on
> the number of choice tasks (t), the number of alternatives (a), and
> the number of analysis cells (c) according to the following equation:
> \(N > 500c/(t*a)\) When considering main effects, ‘c’ is equal to the
> largest number of levels for any of the attributes. When considering
> all two-way interactions, ‘c’ is equal to the largest product of
> levels of any two attributes

Pearmain et al rule of thumb is that "sample sizes over 100 are able to
provide basis for modelling prefernce data", and Lancsar and Louviere
state that you rarely reuire \> 20 respondents per
questionnaire,although more will be required for estimating covariate
effects.

From "Sample Size Issues for Conjoint Analysis" Chapter by Orme: Minimum
200 per group sample size, for non group splitting,minimum of 300
respondents.
