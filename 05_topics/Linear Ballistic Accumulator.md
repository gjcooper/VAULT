# Linear Ballistic Accumulator

Work from [[Scott D. Brown]], [[Andrew Heathcote]], an evidence accumulation model that assumes drift rate variability, where each individual race is a drift sampled from a distribution of mean drift and sd. Comparable in use to the [[diffusion decision model|drift diffusion model]], but analstically simpler.

Has been used in a range of applications, such as perceptual tasks, preferential tasks, risky gambles, memory and many more.
