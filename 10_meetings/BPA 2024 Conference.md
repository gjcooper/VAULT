# BPA 2024 conference

## [[Colleen Loo]] invited speaker talk

Mostly discussion [[ECT]], started talking about Ultrabrief Pulse ECT, good clinically, reduction in cognitive side effects, but also a reduction in efficacy.

How were those cognitive side effect measured (other than the mentioned self-report/third-party report). Faces - hits, word recall, time to orientation. (Recall from previously learned items). also a whole battery of neuropsychological tests, like HVLT, autobiographical - short form (Loo, ..., Scheitzer 2014).

With increased numbers of applications efficacy increased to standard brief ECT on adjusted depression scores.

- Other studies, effects of ECT on heart rate. Much improved in ultra-brief, from levels of ~ 2 out of 9 expected in std brief up to ~ 7 out of 9 in ultrabrief.
- Anaesthesia and ECT. ECT stimulates neurons but anaesthesia reduces neuronal activity. A survey of clinical service, time interval random or dependent on anaesthetist. Time interval from bolus injection had significant effect on [[EEG]] quality after controlling for factors such as age and time since last treatment.
- Computational modelling of ECT, using something like [[tDCS]] in the scanner.

-> Mentions: Bring in the research expertise as clinical expertise although good lacks the experience.
-> Mentions: The benefits of translation, the research will have no real world impact if no-one knows about it.

## Sex differences symposium

- [[Xavier Maddern]] discussed the differential effects of binge drink on the sexes, and highlight the lack of research both in humans and animal models of the alcohol use/abuse in women. Neuro-cognitive effects see a reduction in [[visuospatial task]] performance in males and changes in [[response inhibition]], [[self-monitoring]] and performance on [[social cognitive tasks]] in females.
- [[Eveline Mu ]] perimenopause, depression from fluctuating hormone levels. Plus brain fog. Is menopausal depression distinct? Neuro endocrine changes underlying cause. How do you measure "brain fog"?? Measure madrs depression score, or menopausal specific called meno-d (available from Monash). Menopausal specific quality of life scale also used.

## Data blitz

- cannabis use in adolescents.  Reward processing. [[Monetary Incentive Delay]] task was used as a measure of reward processing.k. Adolescents did not differ from adults.
- food cue reactivity with fMRI - [[Eva g]]. Participants did a beverage task, Dynamic causal modelling of connectivity of bnst and other food reward regions.


## Consortium meeting during lunch
Australian consortium for preclinical psychiatric research. Have applied for a Wellcome trust contract to develop a best animal model for research question website/papers around depression, anxiety and psychosis. Establishing a glossary of terms. 

## Symposium on schizophrenia 

Last talk, adaptive trial design, by dan
Identified key areas for schizophrenia consumers, third area was cognition.

## Highly ranked abstracts

[[Joanna Yau]] Differentiation of neurones in BLA by molecular properties. Fear learning task, twice a day, once neutral and other rewards context with food lever and partial reward. Then fear condition (foot shock as conditioned stimulus) in both contexts on same day.

# Day 2

## Dopamine for learning 

[[Melissa Sharpe]] talks about discriminating between different dopamine circuits so that we can target the circuit we do want to effect, without affecting the ones we don't.

Lots of CS+ and CS- stimuli, so simple cue reward learning, associative learning.

The cognitive lateral hypothalamus in [[Trends in cognitive science]] paper.


## incidental conversation 

Chatted to [[Morgan James]], who did undergrad with Sarah and honours with [[Guy Hawkins|Guy]] and is coming back to Aus from the USA to [[University of Sydney ]]. Discussed my2 work with him.

Talked to [[Yann Quid√©]] about [[ENIGMA]] work from my [[SRI]] day.
