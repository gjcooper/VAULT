# Psychonomics

## Day 1

### My Poster Presentation Notes

Some conversations I had mentioned other models of categorisation that could be useful to investigate.

One of the final people - [[Bartosz Gula]], mentioned that I should look at multiple-cue judgement tasks - perhaps like https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.3758/BF03193103 or https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0096-3445.132.1.133.

A grad student- I think [[Mercury Mason]] - mentioned that other approaches tro categorisation have shown promise in multi-attribute choice - in particular the [[prototype theory]] model of categorisation. He also pointed towards [[Peter Juslin]]'s work on categorisation approaches to multi-attribute.

Perhaps the same person also mentioned [[Ren√© Riedl]] as someone who has investigated decision strategies using process tracing, searching for him found https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BRM.40.3.795, but also some other work to quickly look at like: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10963-3_24

## Day 2

### Improving Memory Search ... - [[Charlotte Cornell]]

MDS like solution over the cue space, model selects cue from unexplored space to "prompt" the participant. Seems to work well.

### Using a measure of probabilistic - [[David Budescu]]

[[Coherence]] - how closely does a persons predictions or probabilistic inferences conform with probability theory.

### Do Numeracy Skills Polarize Climate Change Judgments - [[Jinhyo Cho]]

Skilled Decision Theory in experts and non-experts. People who are numerate are more literate regarding risks, which leads to better knowledge and decision making.

### Accounting for Social Uncertainty in Dynamic Goal Pursuit - [[Simon Farrell]]

2 goals, a race towards a shared goal, and the uncertainty related to that "social" deadline, they also have an individual goal

### Modelling the Influence of Perceived Situational Uncertainty on Everyday Risk Taking - [[Aaron Lob]]

Self-perceived epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty related to knowledge of the context) and how that effects risky choices. At least the ways it was measured here there is no evidence that it can explain the situational uncertainty present in the sample.

### Causal Learning with Interrupted Time Series Data - [[Yiwen Zhang]]

People are **bad** at judging the interrupted time series data. Like really **bad**.

### Attentional Dynamics Explain the Elusive Nature of Context Effects in Decision Making - [[Jennifer Trueblood]]

More detail on the poster I saw by [[Eeshan Hasan]] - in which the model tries to capture a general principle of other attempts to model context effects, that attention matters.

## Day 3

### Symposia on Attention Control

#### Psychometrics of Attention Control - [[Matthew Robison]]

2 Factors, [[Psychomotor Vigilance Task]], [[SART]], x vs [[Simon Squared]], [[Flanker Squared]] and [[Stroop Squared]].

Good in session and between session reliability, 

#### Toolbox approach to assessing individual differences - [[Christopher Draheim]]

So many tasks in these studies, with 

Test equity and personnel selection (Martin et al 2020, Burgoyne 2021b)

#### Linking Issues of Validity and Reliability - [[Julia Haaf]]

github.com/jstbce/acdc-database

Signal to Noise of effect vs trial to trial noise of 1/9.

#### Formally linking computational models... - [[Maria Robinson]]

Missed - watch the video??

#### Electrophys measures of attentional control - [[Anna-lena Schubert]]

N2 and P3 as possible "measures" of attentional control.

### Modular Serial-Parallel Network - [[Mario Fific]]

Along the same lines as Mario's talk from [[CPC2023]], but maybe more focused on decision making.

Utility based approach - aka [[Random Utility Model]] or [[Decision field Theory]] vs a heuristic like [[Take the Best|TTB]]

Risky Gamble example, serial is stochastic version of [[TTB]].

### Attribute Comparibility and Context Effects - [[William Hayes]]

[[Non-comparible attributes]] lead to higher context effects. An application of [[Jennifer Trueblood]]'s work using the [[Markov Attention Process]] and [[Preference Accumulation]]

Experiment 2 used Mouselab,and mousetracking seemed to show process-tracing patterns in the moderate comparibility closer to the low comparibility, but attraction effect did disappear here.

### Cognitive Modeling of Individual-Item - [[Robert M Nosofsky]]

[[hybrid-similarity exemplar model]] used to look at memorability effects in old-new recognition judgements.

Standard similarity model is maybe "wrong"- idea is that items with more distinctive features should match more highly with themselves than those without. Need measures of novelness, or distinctiveness of each item.

### 2AFC and 4AFC Recognition Memory Testing - [[Richard Shiffrin]]

Used the [[Retrieving Effectively from Memory]] model ([[Mark Steyvers]] in 1997).

## Day 4

### Why studying individual differences is hard - [[Jeffrey Rouder]]

More people with messy evidence does not help, increase trial sizes. Makes the case for signal to noise. $\gamma^2$ - the signal to noise ratio (variance from signal / variance from "noise"). Constrained hierarchical factor models.

### Confidence and Accuracy across 2AFC - [[Katarzyna Zawadzka]]

Confidence and Accuracy have a crossover. But then we run 4 2AFC tasks and the crossover effect is not present (Crossover effect here is that accuracy to weak lures vs strong lures is higher, but sometimes confidence increases with strong lures compared to weak lures). 

### Surprise and Prediction error under uncertainty - [[Evan Livesey]]

Surprise is related to prediction error ~ (observed - predicted). Explicit rating of expectancy during a go-nogo task immediately prior to a trial. Different from most Go-Nogo I've seen, the proportion f go to nogo is switched (runs of certain length). People don't expect a go after a bunch of go's, but their responses are faster.

### Strategy Choice in Number Arithmetic - [[David Braithwaite]]

Fraction arithmetic

### Selective Sampling account for forming numerosity - [[Yonatan Vanunu]]

Riffing off Ratcliff [[diffusion decision model|DDM]] - in particular the [[ANS-Diffusion model]]. The [[Selective Sampling and Diffusion Model]]. (SSDM) The assumptions of an underlying process that matches features of the stimulus can create extra ability to interpret the results.

### A simulation approach to assessing the amount... - [[Yiyang Chen]]

[[Signal Detection Theory]] , showing how corrections for infinite $d'$ values can effect estimates of sensitivity.
