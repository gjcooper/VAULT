# Insights from posters

Here are some insights or follow-ups required from the poster sessions at BPA.

#### Interactions of methamphetamine and psilocybin on cognitive flexibility using a novel social reversal learning task in female rats.

Presenter [[Olivia Gilmore KcKimm]] from the School of Psychology, Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney looked at the impact of [[methamphetamine]] and [[psilocybin]] on either sucrose reward or social reward in an reversal learning task. Of note here is the question I didn't get to ask about the "accuracy" measure in the reversal task.

#### How Prior Experience Shapes Adaptation to Changing Reversal Learning Environments in Mice

Presenter [[Eleni Karanicolas]] from the Queensland Brain Institute at the [[University of Queensland]] looked at prior experience in two specific [[reversal learning]] tasks, something called a consecutive correct response protocol where the reversals occurred after six consecutive _correct_ response, or a block protocol where reversals occurred after every 30 trials independent of performance. Measures during this period of environmental uncertainty (CCR vs Block) and during a return to baseline (no reversals any more) were **correct responses** and something called **valid-reward** and **valid-stay** responses.

#### Dopamine Release Capacity in Mice Drives Reversal Learning Performance

Big change of title here ;). Used a [[reversal learning]] task in mice and looked at [[dopamine]] release sites and how they were associated with behaviour in task. The measures used in the reporting of the task were **lose-shift** (no correlation) and **accuracy of stay behaviour** (associated following [[MK801]] treatment)

#### Distinct contribution of cortico-striatal mechanisms to elucidate a pathway for conditioned punishment

[[Cassandra Ma]] looked at instrumental punishment choice and [[Pavlovian]] conditioned suppresion. [[conditioned stimulus]] here is a punishment (shock?).

#### Neurobehavioral determinants of diet-induced obesity

[[Christiana Milleniaputri Suhartono]] is one of the only people I have seen that uses the [[reversal learning]], specifically a deterministic version of a reversal learning task and actually seems to be estimating a [[learning rate]] which she gives the alternative framing of as cognitive flexibility.

Someone like this might be good to reach out to as it seems they are already using a cognitive model in their work.

#### CAN N-ACETYL ASPARTATE BE A USEFUL BIOMARKER FOR COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN
[[Marta Rapado-Castro]] used a lot of [[neuropsychological assessments]] to create something called the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|DLPFC]] cognitive index. This seems to be the mean average of a bunch of Z-scores from many tasks such as:
**[[Global attention]]** - [[Continuous Processing Task|CPT]], [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]], the [[Trail Making Test|TMT]]-A and [[Stroop]] 1 & 2.
**[[Working Memory]]** - [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]]-III digits backwards and letter-number sequencing
**[[Executive Functions]]** - [[Trail Making Test|TMT]] B, [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], [[Stroop]] 3 and [[Verbal Fluency]]
