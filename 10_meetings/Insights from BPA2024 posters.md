# Insights from posters

Here are some insights or follow-ups required from the poster sessions at BPA.

#### Interactions of methamphetamine and psilocybin on cognitive flexibility using a novel social reversal learning task in female rats.

Presenter [[Olivia Gilmore KcKimm]] from the School of Psychology, Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney looked at the impact of [[methamphetamine]] and [[psilocybin]] on either sucrose reward or social reward in an reversal learning task. Of note here is the question I didn't get to ask about the "accuracy" measure in the reversal task.

#### How Prior Experience Shapes Adaptation to Changing Reversal Learning Environments in Mice

Presenter [[Eleni Karanicolas]] from the Queensland Brain Institute at the [[University of Queensland]] looked at prior experience in two specific [[reversal learning]] tasks, something called a consecutive correct response protocol where the reversals occurred after six consecutive _correct_ response, or a block protocol where reversals occurred after every 30 trials independent of performance. Measures during this period of environmental uncertainty (CCR vs Block) and during a return to baseline (no reversals any more) were **correct responses** and something called **valid-reward** and **valid-stay** responses.

#### Dopamine Release Capacity in Mice Drives Reversal Learning Performance

Big change of title here ;). Used a [[reversal learning]] task in mice and looked at [[dopamine]] release sites and how they were associated with behaviour in task. The measures used in the reporting of the task were **lose-shift** (no correlation) and **accuracy of stay behaviour** (associated following [[MK801]] treatment)

#### Distinct contribution of cortico-striatal mechanisms to elucidate a pathway for conditioned punishment

[[Cassandra Ma]] looked at instrumental punishment choice and [[Pavlovian]] conditioned suppresion. [[conditioned stimulus]] here is a punishment (shock?).

#### Neurobehavioral determinants of diet-induced obesity

[[Christiana Milleniaputri Suhartono]] is one of the only people I have seen that uses the [[reversal learning]], specifically a deterministic version of a reversal learning task and actually seems to be estimating a [[learning rate]] which she gives the alternative framing of as cognitive flexibility.

Someone like this might be good to reach out to as it seems they are already using a cognitive model in their work.

#### CAN N-ACETYL ASPARTATE BE A USEFUL BIOMARKER FOR COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN
[[Marta Rapado-Castro]] used a lot of [[neuropsychological assessments]] to create something called the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|DLPFC]] cognitive index. This seems to be the mean average of a bunch of Z-scores from many tasks such as:
**[[Global attention]]** - [[Continuous Processing Task|CPT]], [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]], the [[Trail Making Test|TMT]]-A and [[Stroop]] 1 & 2.
**[[Working Memory]]** - [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]]-III digits backwards and letter-number sequencing
**[[Executive Functions]]** - [[Trail Making Test|TMT]] B, [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], [[Stroop]] 3 and [[Verbal Fluency]]
There was also a related poster using the same measures called "Can N-Acetyl Aspartate Predict Cognitive Development in Early Onset Psychosis by Sex"

#### Revealing a novel role for a dopaminergic projection to ventral hippocampus in reward learning

[[Kiruthika Ganesan]] was studying [[dopamine]] neurons in [[associative learning]] - although the learning here seems much more [[Pavlovian]], with simple cue-reward conditioning and fear conditioning the prevailing behavioural methods. No sign of any cognitive models being applied to the behavioural data.

#### Hippocampally-mediated cognition and hippocampal subfield volume as a function of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder
[[Alexandre Guerin]] looked into cannabis use and [[cannabis]] use disorder, particularly at the relationship between [[hippocampus]] subvolumes, cannabis use and performance on two cognitive tasks. The first task was a [[Mnemonic Similarity Task]] and the second was a [[Modified Benton Visual Retention Test]]. No significant differences were found in the performance on the two tasks between cannabis users and healthy controls, as well as no associations between performance and hippocampal subfield volumes.

#### Reversal Learning in Mice: Model-based vs. Model-free approaches and altering levels of probabilistic uncertainty

[[Laura Kimble]] Looking at Model-based (cognitive map of task environment) vs Model-free (trial-by-trial knowledge to guide choices). Three groups of mice wer trained on two protocols. The block protocol had reversal occurring after every 30 trials and the consecutive correct response, basically the same as the other poster from the QBI by [[Eleni Karanicolas]], [[#How Prior Experience Shapes Adaptation to Changing Reversal Learning Environments in Mice]].

Given the framing of model-free and model-based I expected some modelling to be done, but no it looks again like [[behavioural measures of reinforcement learning]] such as win-stay and lose-shift are being reported. :( 

#### Using a translational task to understand how Lateral hypothalamus may regulate learning processed relevant to schizophrenia and addiction
[[Masakazu Taira]] was looking at the balance of learning about distal and proximal cues. Developed a task that investigates "how rats navigate through cognitive maps using cues with different relative distance to rewards.".

This new task seems to be based on the [[Daw two-step task]]. In the first stage there are two possible distal cues ( a click or white noise) that predict a common or rare second stage (80:20). In the second stage a proximal cue is presented (tone or siren) which predict either a high (80%) reward or a low(20%) reward. (See image below)

This is an interesting design, and I think especially the human version (Daw two-step) is something to investigate further for viability in [[Hypatia Health]]. As with many of these talks the analysis is basic with outcomes from the task related to stay probability after encountering each combination of trials, ie common/reward stay probability, rare/no reward stay probability etc.

#### Understanding persistent detrimental behaviour: External and predictive validity of a novel experimental paradigm
[[Philip Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel]] looked at punishment sensitive vs punishment insensitive individuals. Experiment:
- 2 planets (R1/R2) can be clicked on for probabilistic reward (50% chance of +$100)
- R1 becomes net disadvantageous (R1 -> CS+ -> Attack (lose $))
- Goal - get as many points as possible.
- Two probability groups for CS+ (10% chance of 40% loss vs 40% chance of 10% loss)
Different phenotypes of people (Sensitive, unaware or compulsive)

#### Polygenic Contributions to Cognitive Dysfunction in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder
[[Megan Man]]  along with [[Yann Quid√©]] and [[Melissa Green]] look at the association between [[poiygenic risk scores]] and cognitive functions. The three areas of cognitive function were:
- general cognitive function as assessed by the [[Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status|RBANS]]
- [[executive function]] as indexed by average z-score of perfrmance on the [[Trail Making Test]]-B, digit symbol coding and digit span subtest scores from the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]]-Revised and the within-search errors from the [[CANTAB]] Spatial Working Memory test.
- [[processing speed]] measured using the time taken to complete the [[Trail Making Test]]-A.
