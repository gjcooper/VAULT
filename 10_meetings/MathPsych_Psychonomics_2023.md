# Causes and Actions

### Causality as empowerment - [[Alison Gopnik]]

Use "empowerment" as the reward function of a [[reinforcement learning]] model, where empowerment is maximising the effort expended to obtain new information about the environment.

### From causes to actions - [[Samantha Kleinberg]]

Large complex models are appropriate to complex systems, but people can't use them to effectively make good decisions. If you simplify the model and extract only the parts that are applicable to the decision being made.

How do you do that part though?

### Aligning robot representations with humans - [[Anca Dragan]]

More videos of cute kids in my talks.

Using deep learning can't solve the issues due to the entangled mess of spurious correlations.

Teach the features important to the end user, and rather than make the robot learn the missing features implicitly, get the end user to teach them explicitly.

### Active Causal Learning - [[Todd Gureckis]]

Optimal Experiment Design as a way of thinking about how people interact with the world of learning causal relationships in the world - see [[Expected Information Gain]] (EIG) for an example of an applicable model.

A parameter that measures the relative level of the two strategies (EIG) or the Positive Testing Strategy.

### Cognitive science requires causal abstraction analysis - [[Noah Goodman]]

Dystopian futures! Interchange interventions (Geiger et al 2020) as a way of mapping interventions in a high-level causal model.

### Counterfactual simulation in causal cognition - [[Tobias Gerstenberg]]

Causal judgements in physics engines.
