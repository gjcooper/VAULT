# Mini Conference Amsterdam

## Andrew Heathcote

Talked about the TRDM (I know this one) but also the ALBA, which is the basis for Steve's talk and combines [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator|LBA]] to get at competition between accumulators in a decision process (brightness discrimination in particular)

## Steve Miletic

RL-ARD ([[reinforcement learning]] - Advantage Racing Diffusion)

## Dora Matzke

Hmm, SSRT stuff, but an extensions to BEESTS (BEESTS-CV) that deals with context violations in the ARI (Anticipatory Response Inhibition) task.

ARIis two dials (quite similar to Alex's tracking task) that also includes a stop process.

## Quentin Gronau

SSRT and estimation for a dual response task (Respond to two stim, inhibit both or inhibit one response)

## Udo Boehm

Hierarchical model for diffusion ([[diffusion decision model|DDM]]) that works on massive (\~5000) subjects with small numbers of trials (50).

## Julia Haaf

Some interesting differences between Hierarchical bayesian estimatio between BayesFactor and STAN, leading to a talk about shrinkage
