# Australasian MathPsych Conference 2021

* My talk went \~ OK, no questions other than after the session, just about what consistency meant in this context.

## Talks to watch/rewatch

* Samuel Hardings talk on dynamic perception revealed by cursor movements, fair bit of talk on selective influence/SFT stuff
* Neo Poon's talk on the process-tracing study
* Saoirse's talk on censor detection, I think it was about quality ratings and prior information.
* Scott Herbert- Pursuing multiple goals... Interested in the capacity aspect of the talk.
