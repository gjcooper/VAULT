# MBBL Symposium 2020 (Day 1)

## First talk

*Martin Meißner (Zeppelin University)*
**Bottom-up and Top-down processes of visual attention**

Scarcity mechanism, Orquin et al 2020, the visual ecology of humans is a product of culture. (Good review of the literature)

Salience manipulation, effects bottom-up first fixation to product. Top down manipulation (inform users of that this is an ad), interaction with bottom-up, no change to first fixation, but high salience and informed users reduces to low salience the overall relative timeof fixation to the target product.

## Second talk

Kristian Rotaru, Mood/emotion influence on trading. Not too interesting, but the platform for trading experiments seems interesting. Also need to look at Granger causality.

# MBBL Symposium 2020 (Day 2)

## First talk

*Jacob Orquin* 

Talked about visual ecology, not as impressive as talked up to be. Experiment was manipulations of product packaging.

## Second Talk

**Session Title: “Determining the relative importance of stopover destination attributes: Integrating stated importance, choice experiment, and eye-tracking measures”**

*Presented by: Professor Harmen Oppewal, Monash Business School*

Discrete Choice Experiment vs Directly stated on rating scale\!

### Follow up final chats

Computation complexity with *Elizabeth Bowman* using eyetracking. *Kristian (talker)*

*Jacob Orquin* - machine intelligence used to classify eye movement, fixations etc
