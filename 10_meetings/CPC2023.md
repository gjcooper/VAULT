### Seeing in Depth - [[Christopher W. Tyler]]

Masolino da Panicale - first perspective artist??

Time course of perceived depth - bayesian reweighting. Would like to rea dmore about this.

The work on depth cue combination is also interesting. Landy et al on an averaging of veridical clues.

### Spatial reasoning mimicry - [[Patrick Garrigan]]

ChatGPT is bad at rotation, but did quite well with object position movements.

Interesting question about debriefing questions of ChatGPT.

### If you thought Triangles... [[Gideon Caplovitz]]

Some fun visual effects? with circles. Binding ring illusion etc. 

FLIM, FLIIM and FLIMS

### What causes warping - [[Nicholas Baker]]

Object based warping (shape behind two dots increases distance between the dots).

Dots == Line segments < outline == silhouette.

### Differential Effects of multisensory - [[Yi Liu]]

Are behavioural benefits (< RT, > accuracy) in multisensory stimuli from redundant stimuli features alone, or does cross modality add extra benefit.

CDF inequality analysis.

violation curve = $F_{AV/AA/VV} - \text{Upper bound}$ 

Also looked at workload capacity $C(t)$.

Multi-sensory integration > 2 sources alone

### Dynamic Interactions of top-down - [[Cheng-Ta Yang]]

BG of Cheng-ta, 

Properties:
- Serial vs Parallel (vs Co-active)
- Decision stopping rule (Exhaustive, self-terminating)
- Workload capacity (Limited, Unlimited, Super-capacity)
Continuum from Holistic -> Analytic

Tang et. al. 2019 -> If you cue locations does this change the processing strategy. Yes, people can adapt to the cues.

### Efficiency in redundancy - [[Ami Eidels]]

Can 2 [[DDM]] provide an advantage over 1 DDM for accuracy/RT (or reward rate)

### Varieties of selective influence - [[James T. Townsend]]

Direct Non-selective influence, Indirect Non-selective influence. -> look to mdpi.

### A topological approach to emotion - [[Kamilya Salibayeva]]

Embedding emotion onto non-euclidean spaces.

### Analytic Transformation of Facial Holism - [[Mario Fific]]

How to integrate holistic and analytic encoding?

Modular Serial Parallel Network.
