# Notes and resources from the 2025 meeting of Computational Psychiatry

## Day 1

A less inflammatory talk by [[Philip Corlett]] than necessarily expected, with an associated change of title. This talk discussed delusions and paranoia, highlighting that general deficits in learning can explain results rather than a social specific cognition.

There was also a primer on reinforcement learning. This was primarily reiterating aspects I knew - placing Rl in the framework of other learning "algorithms" (Supervised/unsupervised). There was some interest towards the end where other **time-dependent** learning frameworks that focus less on a fixed learning rate and more on learning rates that vary in response to attention (Mackintosh) or the level of suprise (Pearce and Hall). The talk finished with a quick introduction to Bayesian Learner models.

## Day 2

Normative modelling and velocity changelines talk - the application discussed was in brain region size (ventricles etc) however is a approach like this applicable to computationla parameter values. There is a quesrion about age related changes over time - what is the normative variation linked to other aspects (age, sex, etc). There would also be a question of measurement specificity.

Gamified tasks - what works and what doesn't. How can we create a task that is engaging enough to keep motivation in our participants (patients) but also clearly activate the required decision making we wdiscriminabilityant to probe.

There was an interesting poster on a systematic review of the discriminability of a range of tasks (cognitive effort, reinforcement learning, etc) on treatment outcomes for a [[CBT]] intervention. See a photo for more details.
