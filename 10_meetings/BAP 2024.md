# British Association for Psychopharmacology summer meeting

Modelling work presented at the conference included. Perhaps some directions here for the [[Hypatia Work]]

- THE SEROTONIN HYPOTHESIS OF DEPRESSION  (Cowen PJ, Psychiatry, Oxford University) _Better understanding will come from improved technological methods, including  more direct measurement of serotonin release in the human brain and computational models of the role of  serotonin in neuropsychological functioning and mental life_
- THE SAME SYMPTOM, THE SAME MECHANISMS ACROSS CONDITIONS? REWARD-RELATED AND  NEUROMETABOLIC MODELS OF FATIGUE: CREATING SPACE FOR TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT  (Godlewska BR, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford) _I will present a compact view  of the postulated mechanisms of fatigue, in particular reward-related and neurometabolic models._
- CHRONIC FATIGUE – UNDERSTANDING MECHANISMS AND A CASE FOR PHENOTYPING FATIGUE (Kuppuswamy A, Institute of Neurology, University College London) _I will be presenting a disease independent model of fatigue, with examples from stroke literature in support of the new sensory attenuation model of fatigue_
- APPROXIMATE ESTIMATION OF UNCERTAINTY; MECHANISMS AND LINKS TO MENTAL HEALTH (Wise T, Department of Neuroimaging, King’s College London) _This talk will present work using computational modelling to establish mechanisms with which people  approximate uncertainty about the structure of their environment, and linking individual differences in these processes to transdiagnostic symptoms of mental health problems_
- COGNITIVE EFFORT-BASED DECISION MAKING: CONTRIBUTIONS TO SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION, AND MODULATION BY NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION (Bustamante LA, Dept of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis) _Effort avoidance is captured by larger changes in participants’ ‘exit thresholds’ (i.e., reward expected for harvesting on exit trials) between low and high effort conditions, corresponding to higher effort cost model-based estimates._
- COMPUTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY IN INFANCY: UNLOCKING POTENTIAL FOR EARLY INTERVENTION (Lawson RP, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge) _We were able to validate computational models of infant behaviour to the same standards as would be expected of adults (e.g. good parameter recoverability, model identifiability and simulated behavioural responses) and show that prediction errors correlated with post-switch increases in pupil size; consistent with phasic noradrenaline release following violation of expectations_
- THE EFFECT OF ANXIETY INDUCED BY CARBON DIOXIDE ON RISK AND LOSS AVERSION  (Armstrong MJ, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London) _A Prospect Theory computational model (Mkrtchian et al., 2023) was applied to the results of this task in order to elucidate risk and loss aversion in their decision making._
- UNDERSTANDING THE COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS OF ESCITALOPRAM’S EFFECTS ON DECISION MAKING IN PATIENTS WITH MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS (Mena CI, ICN, UC) _Bayesian Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) models were fit to the choice data using an MCMC method. Differences were calculated using highest density intervals (HDI) on the posteriors of the hyper-parameters_
- EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR DURING ANXIETY - AN FMRI STUDY USING THE THREAT OF SHOCK PARADIGM (Tertikas G, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research - Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College of London) _Computational models of exploration were employed and the winning model consisted of a Thompson model with an ε-greedy component (representing random exploration) and a novelty bonus η (representing de-novo exploration)._
- INVESTIGATING VOLATILITY PROCESSING AND VALENCE BIASES ACROSS ANXIETY AND AUTISM (Xiao B, Dept of Psychology, University of Cambridge) _We preregistered the expected learning rate patterns for all four groups, and used grid-search to estimate valenced learning rates with Rescorla-Wagner models._
- DEPRESSION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER REWARD SENSITIVITY DURING EFFORT-BASED DECISION MAKING WHICH IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT WITH DOPAMINE (Costello HC, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London) _The primary outcome variable was choice (accept/decline offer), which we analysed using both logistic mixed- effects modelling and a computational model which dissected the individual contributions of reward and effort on depression and dopamine state in PD._
- NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF DELAY DISCOUNTING IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AND COCAINE-ADDICTED PATIENTS (Graczyk MM, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge) _We calculated two behavioural parameters:  the delay discounting rate (k) and the choice sharpness (b), using four different methods: (i) the widely- used hyperbola method, (ii) a logistic regression, (iii) a single-subject Bayesian approach, and (iv) a full hierarchical Bayesian approach with hyperbola algorithm_
- THE SUBJECTIVE VALUE OF ALCOHOL: AN ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (Yates JD, Psychology, University of Liverpool) _Recent theoretical predictions (Field et al., 2020) have been made to suggest that value-based models (Berkman et al., 2017) can provide the framework to explain the processes underlying excessive alcohol-use_
- REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MECHANISMS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS (RELMED) (Abir Y, Institute of Neurology, UCL) _A systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on how pharmacological manipulations affect RL task performance identified key RL domains, including appetitive and aversive instrumental and Pavlovian learning, Pavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer, response vigour, working-memory, controllability and model-based decisions._
- COMPUTATIONAL METABOLIC PSYCHIATRY: REWARD LEARNING IS ASSOCIATED WITH GLUCOSE REGULATION (Fleming HA, MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge) _For the RL task, we fitted several computational Q-learning models, obtaining the best fit using separate learning rates for presence and omission of reward._
- UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF LEARNING FIDELITY ON EFFORT-BASED DECISION-MAKING (Guinea CG, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge) _Crucially, models which account for individual differences in learning fidelity better explain effort choices than models that assume all participants learn equally (BIC = 14925.69 and 15807.46 respectively)._
- DIFFERENCES IN INFORMATION SAMPLING BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN NEUROTYPICAL AND NEURODIVERSE POPULATIONS (Illingworth BJG, Psychiatry, University of Cambridge) _Neuroeconomic measures of gain efficiency were calculated and a Bayesian subjective costs model was fit to the data to explain task behaviour_
- EXAMINING THE CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN AUTISTIC TRAITS, OCCIPITAL GABA, AND PERCEPTION IN HUMANS (Jassim N, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge) _Task performance was further probed through hierarchical drift diffusion modelling (DDM)_
- COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING AND NEURAL CORRELATES OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOLLOWING CHRONIC ESCITALOPRAM: A DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED SEMI-RANDOMISED STUDY (Langley C, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge) _We analysed group differences in reinforcement learning using both analysis of covariance and innovative hierarchical Bayesian modelling techniques_
- COMPONENTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY MAY HAVE DISTINCT COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS: A REPLICATION AND EXTENSION (Dercon Q, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, UCL) _Computational modelling revealed a specific effect of the BA intervention in reducing effort sensitivity–the perceived effort required to complete actions–relative to CR-randomised individuals)_
- PREDICTING SOCIAL, COGNITIVE, AND EMOTIONAL PROCESSES IN MOOD DISORDERS -RELIABILITY OF NEUROCOGNITIVE MARKERS IN AFFECTIVE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES (Lau IHW, MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (MRC CBU), University of Cambridge) _we examined the computational mechanisms of social learning utilising the Social Evaluation Learning Task-Revised (Moutoussis et al., 2023, bioArVix [Preprint], 1-13). Our investigation focused on testing the ‘classify-refine’ model, characterised by swift ‘first impression’ classification followed by gradual adjustments, to elucidate social learning patterns._
- A SHARED NEUROCOGNITIVE SIGNATURE OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER AND METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION (Mehrhof SZ, MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge) _Using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we obtained computational parameters quantifying individuals’ motivational decision-making process_
- AVERSIVE LEARNING, STRESS AND SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL: A COMPUTATIONAL FACTOR  MODELLING APPROACH (Sandhu TR, MRC CBU, University of Cambridge) _Data were analysed with model-free and model-based (Hierarchical Gaussian Filter; HGF) approaches, and questionnaire measures were collected for transdiagnostic computational factor modelling_
- EXPLORATION TASKS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION  (Witte K, Human-Centered AI, Helmholtz Munich) _In laboratory settings, this type of decision-making is often tested using few-armed bandit tasks, where participants choose between two to four options and attempt to maximize their rewards throughout the study. Computational models of behaviour have been used to uncover the cognitive processes underlying these types of decisions and relate them to psychiatric traits._
