# Webinar for OHBM Australia (2021-03-23)

All about linking brain and behaviour.

## Talk 1

**Connectome-Based Predictive Modelling** **Predictive Model Anatomy**
*Rosenberg et al (2016) J Neurosci*

Model generalisability, does the model generalise across:

* People
* Task Conditions
* Participant populations
* Data collection sites
* Behavioural Measures

Model Specificity. is the model specific to the behaviour of interest

Model Prediction, does the model predict:

- individual differences
- intra-individual differences (changes over time for individual)

## Talk 2

Get to the fricken point, stop talking about low N.

Missed most of the rest, bathroom

## Talk 3

Functional and Structural Connectivity are much better predictors of behaviour

## Talk 4

*Jeggan Tiego*

Improving replicability, increase phenotypical precision.

Mentiona IRT, and the two parameter logistic model (2PL)
