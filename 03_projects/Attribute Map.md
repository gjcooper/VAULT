# Attribute Map

The attribute map task was an attempt at something quite different to my other work.

Rather than look at many responses from people, and try to investigate the processing architectures responsible for producing the responses, instead the aim here was to present options that varied along 1 or 2 dimensions, but with few responses per person. Then global patterns of response biases for each category (attribute alone, one attribute fixed or both attributes varying) were attempted to be made.
