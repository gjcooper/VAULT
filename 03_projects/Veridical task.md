# Veridical choice, binary context

This note describes the veridical #task, both Numeric and Symbolic versions designed and run in 2019 for my #PhD. These tasks introduce a simple single option, two attribute binary choice, somewhat similar to [[fisher2017attentional|Fisher's binary-attribute choice task]].

The task was written in [[Expyriment]], and run in lab. Both task versions had the context of a series of hotels being considered for an overnight stay.

## Numeric version

Participants were instructed to make choices (contextually on behalf of someone else) and given an explicit rule, in one of two conditions:

* Condition 1 had participants accepting the option if the price (attribute 1) was less than $500 **and** if the rating (attribute 2) was greater than 50%, otherwise they were instructed to reject.
* Condition 2 had participants accepting the option if the price was less than $500 **or** if the rating was greater than 50%, otherwise they should reject.
