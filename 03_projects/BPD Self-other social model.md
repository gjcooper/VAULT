# Notes and thoughts on the BPD computational model project

### Questions
- A lot of acronyms, particular ones to look up are [[Childhood Trauma Questionnaire|CTQ]], [[Revised Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale|RGPTS]] (Subscale B), [[Mentalisation Questionnaire|MZQ]] and [[Certainty About Mental States Questionnaire|CAMSQ]].
- What is a [[Fehr-Schmoidt utility function]]?
- How does the [[Hierarchical Bayesian Inference algorithm]] work? See the paper in Zotero.
- What does it mean to centre and scale dependent regressors?
- What does exceedance probability mean and what does Model responsibility mean.

### Thoughts

- If [[Borderline Personality Disorder|BPD]] participants rapidly change beliefs at the start of observation and then remain steady, how stable is that initial representation. If the partners initial draws from a distribution are towards one of the tails of the generating distribution, does the final estimnated mean get significantly shifted in that directly. That is are they resistant to updating their initial assessment of a partners beliefs?
- In the Intentions Game, partners in phase 2 were chosen to act ~ 50% different from the participant in phase 1. What does 50% different mean in this case?
- In healthy controls the best fitting model for them was one that _allows_ for social insertion and social contagion. What is the level of variation in these two parameters across the population? If you fit the same model on BPD what amount of variation do you see there?
