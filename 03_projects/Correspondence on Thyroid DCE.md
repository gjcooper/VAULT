# [[Thyroid]] Project

## March 24

### Suggested clinical Vignette:

You are a 50-year-old person without any significant past medical
history who has been referred to a local thyroid surgeon for discussion
about your newly diagnosed thyroid cancer. This is a single small
(1.5cm) papillary thyroid cancer that in the left lobe of the thyroid.
It is isolated to that lobe with no local invasion. There is no spread
of cancer to any lymph nodes or elsewhere in the body. You have also had
no significant history of radiation exposure or family history of
thyroid cancer.

We have picked this as it would an appropriate cancer to manage under
any of the 3 management choices.

### Possible numbers for sample size:

Available patients HNE â€“ we have about 100 new thyroid cancer diagnoses
each year in HNE. We are currently recruiting these for HRQoL surveys
with stricter eligibility criteria meaning that only \~ 50% (approx.)
are eligibile. We had some issues with recruitemtn last year but now
recruitment is approaching 50%. We do 300-400 thyroid operations for
benign disease a year (this is public and private). We could look at
recruiting these patients if needed.

It would be nice to consider a multicentre trial.

RNSH (University of Sydney) probably do \>1000 thyroid operations a year
(cancer and benign). Probably 200 or more cancers a year. RMH
(University of Melbourne) are also interested in collaborating. We are
not entirely sure of their numbers.
