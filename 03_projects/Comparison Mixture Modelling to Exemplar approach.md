Outlined here is a comparison between the [[Modelling of Veridical and Preferential Choice|mixture modelling approach]] used in the veridical task, and the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model]].

Mixture Modelling Approach | Rating | Exemplar-based Consumer Choice Model | Rating
-- | -- | -- | --
Needs Adaptive preferential Task | ❌ | Needs 2-option, 2-attr task | ❌
Hope the adaptive task works! | ❌ | Uncertain how to extend to 2-option | ❌
Follows on from previous work well | ✔️ | Story follows for thesis less naturally | ❌
Complicated to extend to > 1 option | ❌ | Solution is simpler to estimate | ✔️
Need to develop my own online Quest+ alternative, or move to in lab task | ❌ | Currently "working" for Veridical, Preferential, AttrMap | ✔️
No easy way to incorporate MDS task | ❌ | If the 2-option approach works then it could be extended to include the [[Multidimensional Scaling Phones\|MDS Phones]] task | ✔️
