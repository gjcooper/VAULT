# MDS Phones Task

The MDS phones task looked to use a set of phones either correlated in attributes (from real phones at JB HiFi), or using the same attributes, but uncorrelated. The idea behind the task was to use [[Multidimensional Scaling]] to look at the psychological distance between phones on the 5 attribute dimensions, and use this distance to reduce to a subset of dimensions to then model using the [[Modelling of Veridical and Preferential Choice|mixture modelling]] approach, or something similar.
