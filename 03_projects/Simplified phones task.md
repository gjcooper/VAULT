# Simplified Phones task

This task is designed to act as a link between simpler binary choice (single option, double attribute) analyses for the [[Exemplar-based consumer choice model|EB-CCM]], and more complex stimuli like the [[Multidimensional Scaling Phones|MDS Phones]] task with > 1 option and > 2 attributes.

The initial goal of this task is to interleave short blocks of trials with one of two possible trial types, either:
- a single option and two attributes, with instructions similar to "Please choose whether you would consider this phone (Accept) or not (Reject)".
- two options and two attributes, with instructions similar to "Please choose the option you prefer between the two shown below".

Other design aspects are that the order of attributes should be stable for each participant, but randomly chosen between participants. The order of block presentation (Single, Double, Single, Double, ...) should be alternating, but the first presented block should be counterbalanced between participants.

Initial pilots will use 150 trials each of the single option and double option types, to see how long it will take. The single option trials will be randomly sampled from the price and memory attribute values (minus the 1000Gb memory phone due to the fact that this phone does not match the exponentially increasing pattern from the other phone memory values). The double option trials will be sampled randomly from pairwise combinations of the single option stimuli. See https://github.com/CooperAcademia/SimplifiedPhones2023/blob/main/design_scripts/attribute_investigation.Rmd for an investigation of this effect.
