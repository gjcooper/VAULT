Similarity judgements in naturalistic stimuli. Reading [[marjieh2024universal]] I was struck by the paradigm and thinking through how many different features are used by people when making similarity judgements. For instance when looking at the example animals images (bear and penguin) I found myself thinking that a snap judgement call would be dissimilar based on animal category (bird vs mammal), but more similar based on diet (fish) and climate (colder climates). Thus depending upon which features are salient at any particular time in the participants mind, the similarity could be based on 1 or more features, and which features are used is likely to differ between participants.

Some questions that immediately come to mind:
- Some features will be more **obvious** than others when looking at a pair of stimuli (ie elements like how strongly a feature is associated with one (or both) of the stimuli). Are these obvious features/dimensions selected more often for the similarity rating?
- Within a larger category (animal image similarities) how stable are the dimensions with which stimuli are rated?
- What flavour of features are used (semantic, perceptual, hierarchical)?
- Does variety of feature selection correspond to any participant creativity indices
