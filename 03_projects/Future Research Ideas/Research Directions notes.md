# Notes for research future meeting

These are some _rough_ ideas for my meeting with Joe tonight, they are roughly broken into two sections, modelling methodology and modelling applications

## Modelling Methodology

- Sampler comparisons in complex cognitive models
    -  [[stan]] vs [[PMwG]] vs [[JAGS]] vs [[DE-MCMC]]
    - Models like [[diffusion decision model|DDM]], [[reinforcement learning]], [[Social Cognition]]?
- Identifying badly behaved models.
- Model comparison metrics, comparisons, uses and recommendations

## Modelling Applications

- Beliefs about others / Intentions game
    -  What happens with significant violations of that belief.
- How does a highly uncertain environment effect learning. Possible collaborator [[Tin Nguyen]] with his learning about the preferences of others [[DCE]] task.
