# Exemplar-based consumer choice model

Taking inspiration from the [[Generalised Context Model]]  the first iteration of this approach takes a look at the single option choice sets that I have done, including the [[Veridical task]], the [[Preferential task]] and the [[Attribute Map]] task.

Outlined roughly the approach is to set the exemplar to be (0, 0), that is price anchored to $0 and quality or rating anchored to 0% or 0 stars. Then each individual option is "compared" to this anchor, and the GCM uses modelling to tease apart the:
* "weight" given to each attribute
* "distance" metric form
* "sensitivity" to distances in attribute space, and
* the choice "offset" relative to the anchor
