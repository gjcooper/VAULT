# HGF large age spread Juanita

To implement the  [[Hierarchical Gaussian Filter|HGF]] on some [[Mismatch Negativity|MMN]] data for a frozen sequence for [[Juanita Todd]].

For the root folder see:

//entities/research/MMN/MMN Reversal across the ages

Processed data has multiple process methods, including Analyzer, baseline corrected and artifact rejected. .eeg files from analyser, cnt files maybe from analyser.

Between each sequence there is a minute break, no breaks between blocks (four blocks per sequence).

When you did a blink correction it added separate markers that messed up comparisons between artifact rejection and just baseline correction.

All acquired in Neuroscan.

Specific details on the analysis can be found at [[HGF analysis of MMN]].
