# Journal of Experimental Psychology: General

This journal is from the American Psychological Association and publishes work applicable to two or more areas from psychology. A rough rule of thumb might be that if your article could be published in any two or more of the sister journals ([[JEPLMC]], [[JEPHPP]], [[JEPABP]] or [[JEPApplied]]) and/or  concerns other sub-disciplines of psychology such as social processes, developmental processes, mental illness, neuroscience or computation modelling then it may be a good fit for the journal.

The journal accepts longer submissions of empirical reports, and also a format called brief reports that are up to 3000 words.
