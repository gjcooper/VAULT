# What is the purpose in using AI for research

What do I aim to use AI for in my scientific research.

- Automated research literature exploration: Given a topic or a source, have a conversation with AI or an automated tool to:
    1. Verify the topic of interest
    2. Examine where the topic can be broadened or narrowed in scope.
    3. Suggest literature that matches the defined topic or source.
    4. Prune suggested literature tree by field, area or investigation techniques.
- Researcher on my shoulder, that when given access to my current research in progress, including code, notes etc:
    1. Can question me to look for missing information (like to fill out a preregistration report). This should be context aware based on reg reports that match the methods/field.
    2. Can look through my code for simple logic errors, suggest improvements, etc.
    3. Can assess suitability of the proposed analysis methods for the research questions being asked.
