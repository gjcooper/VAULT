# Information for thesis

The page: https://www.newcastle.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/459022/Thesis-Examination-Guidelines.pdf outlines in general terms the requirements for a thesis at Newcastle, like margins for printed versions, fonts and font size and required statements for thesis type (by publications etc)

### Response from Guy

Great questions. The short answer is that there are no clear rules. My guiding principle is to (a) do what is clearest for the reader, and (b) if you have published papers then keep them as close as possible to the published version.

(a) helps both you and the reader.

(b) is more subtle. The assessor can then see that the content of a chapter is already published. This makes their job of assessing the content easier because it’s already been peer reviewed. This differs to a straight thesis chapter which is yet to be peer reviewed.

The more direct answer to your questions is:

- Yes, references can all go to the end. Keep some front matter from the paper in the thesis chapter – the title, authors, abstract. Add a note that makes it very clear the content of the chapter has been published as a paper in journal X.
- Appendices could appear at the end of the thesis, I think. Again – there’s no hard and fast rule, so pick what you think makes it easiest for a reader to follow.

Hope this helps!
#### HDR Festival spiel

Imagine you are a new parent trying to pick out some baby food. Given the many possibilities, it is unreasonable to compare all options against each other. Instead, we may quickly consider each option, rejecting some and accepting others for further consideration.
Given a small set of attributes (price, quantity, health rating), we may compare each food's values of these attributes to some _aspiration_ level, some internal value for that attribute. Many possible strategies for this comparison have been investigated in the literature. We could reject after the first "bad" attribute or reject if all attributes are "bad". Perhaps instead, a consumer may combine all attribute values, allowing "good" attributes to compensate for "bad" attributes.

Inferring the decision strategy actually employed by any individual is often difficult. People aren't always conscious of their decision strategy, so self-reporting can be problematic. Different strategies can also lead to similar choice patterns, so looking at choices alone is often insufficient. Alternative methods tell you about the order in which attributes were attended to but cannot infer how that information is integrated.

Throughout my PhD, I have explored ways to infer decision strategies on options by classifying each strategy by their assumptions about processing individual attributes. I have then applied models developed for perceptual decision-making to identify these component processes. Given information about the component processes and how they are combined then allows inferences about the higher-level strategies used.

My recent work investigates whether simple consumer choices could be investigated using categorisation models. The idea is that given enough examples, people begin to make quick judgements, classifying each new option (i.e. food) into a "good" or "bad" category. This approach is currently showing promise.

### Title pages for chapters

For the **PhD** thesis I can add a title page to the chapters by adding something like what is outlined on https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/91420/119878 (using the `titlesec` package)
