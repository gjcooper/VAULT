# Parallel port drivers

If wanting to run an application that interfaces with a parallel port on Windows you might find yourself in need of a driver. You can still find an old "open source"-ish driver available at https://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/ for download that can assist with this.

Mostly for myself I have used this driver when communicating with EEG systems via a parallel port cable and with open source experimental software.
